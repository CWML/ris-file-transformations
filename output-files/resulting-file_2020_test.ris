AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of urolithiasis has increased in both the developed and the developing countries during the past decades. Economically, the increase of urolithiasis contributes to the rise of the healthcare burden everywhere. Moreover, this increase has been associated with a change in the epidemiology of urolithiasis in terms of age and sex distribution, and also the location and type of calculi., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE for relevant literature dating back to 1980. This review compared the trends in epidemiological factors affecting urolithiasis in the developed and the developing countries during the past decades., RESULTS: People in the developing countries are more likely to contract kidney calculi at a younger age than in the developed countries. Although calculus disease is still more prevalent in men than in women, the latter are increasingly affected in both worlds. Uric acid calculi are more prevalent in the developing than in industrialized countries. There is a progressive increase in the frequency of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate calculi in the developing countries where these used to be less frequent., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of urinary calculi is increasing globally. Many factors including aging of the population, changes in diet, global warming, and employment of more accurate diagnostic tools seem to be involved in this increase. An increasing affluence and adaptation of Western diet habits in many developing countries seem likely to contribute to the changes.

TI  - Assessing Heat Stress and Health among Construction Workers in a Changing Climate: A Review
AU  - Acharya, Payel; Boggess, Bethany; Zhang, Kai
AB  - Construction workers are at an elevated risk of heat stress, due to the strenuous nature of the work, high temperature work condition, and a changing climate. An increasing number of workers are at risk, as the industry's growth has been fueled by high demand and vast numbers of immigrant workers entering into the U.S., the Middle East and Asia to meet the demand. The risk of heat-related illnesses is increased by the fact that little to no regulations are present and/or enforced to protect these workers. This review recognizes the issues by summarizing epidemiological studies both in the U.S. and internationally. These studies have assessed the severity with which construction workers are affected by heat stress, risk factors and co-morbidities associated with heat-related illnesses in the construction industry, vulnerable populations, and efforts in implementing preventive measures.

TI  - Prevalence and burden of chronic kidney disease among the general population and high-risk groups in Africa: A systematic review
AU  - Abd Elhafeez, S.; Bolignano, D.; D'Arrigo, G.; Dounousi, E.; Tripepi, G.; Zoccali, C.
AB  - Objectives While increasing attention is paid to the rising prevalence of chronic diseases in Africa, there is little focus on chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review assesses CKD burden among the general population and high-risk groups on the entire African continent. Design, setting and participants We searched Medline and PubMed databases for articles published between 1 January 1995 and 7 April 2017 by sensitive search strategies focusing on CKD surveys at the community level and high-risk groups. In total, 7918 references were evaluated, of which 7766 articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thus, 152 studies were included in the final analysis. Outcome measurement The prevalence of CKD in each study group was expressed as a range and pooled prevalence rate of CKD was calculated as a point estimate and 95% CI. No meta-analysis was done. Data were presented for different populations. Results In the community-level studies, based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies, the prevalence of CKD ranged from 2% to 41% (pooled prevalence: 10.1%; 95% CI 9.8% to 10.5%). The prevalence of CKD in the high-risk groups ranged from 1% to 46% (pooled prevalence: 5.6%; 95% CI 5.4% to 5.8%) in patients with HIV (based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies), 11%-90% (pooled prevalence: 24.7%; 95% CI 23.6% to 25.7%) in patients with diabetes (based on all available studies which are of low quality except four of medium quality) and 13%-51% (pooled prevalence: 34.5%; 95 % CI 34.04% to 36%) in patients with hypertension (based on all available studies which are of low quality except two of medium quality). Conclusion In Africa, CKD is a public health problem, mainly attributed to high-risk conditions as hypertension and diabetes. The poor data quality restricts the validity of the findings and draws the attention to the importance of designing future robust studies.Copyright 漏 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

TI  - Changes in population susceptibility to heat and cold over time: assessing adaptation to climate change
AU  - Arbuthnott, Katherine; Hajat, Shakoor; Heaviside, Clare; Vardoulakis, Sotiris
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of a warming climate and increasing urbanisation (with the associated urban heat island effect), interest in understanding temperature related health effects is growing. Previous reviews have examined how the temperature-mortality relationship varies by geographical location. There have been no reviews examining the empirical evidence for changes in population susceptibility to the effects of heat and/or cold over time. The objective of this paper is to review studies which have specifically examined variations in temperature related mortality risks over the 20(th) and 21(st) centuries and determine whether population adaptation to heat and/or cold has occurred., METHODS: We searched five electronic databases combining search terms for three main concepts: temperature, health outcomes and changes in vulnerability or adaptation. Studies included were those which quantified the risk of heat related mortality with changing ambient temperature in a specific location over time, or those which compared mortality outcomes between two different extreme temperature events (heatwaves) in one location., RESULTS: The electronic searches returned 9183 titles and abstracts, of which eleven studies examining the effects of ambient temperature over time were included and six studies comparing the effect of different heatwaves at discrete time points were included. Of the eleven papers that quantified the risk of, or absolute heat related mortality over time, ten found a decrease in susceptibility over time of which five found the decrease to be significant. The magnitude of the decrease varied by location. Only two studies attempted to quantitatively attribute changes in susceptibility to specific adaptive measures and found no significant association between the risk of heat related mortality and air conditioning prevalence within or between cities over time. Four of the six papers examining effects of heatwaves found a decrease in expected mortality in later years. Five studies examined the risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related mortality in later time periods., CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that across a number of different settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk. A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown. Adaptation to heat has implications for future planning, particularly in urban areas, with anticipated increases in temperature due to climate change.

AU  - Soderland, Peter; Lovekar, Shachi; Weiner, Daniel E.; Brooks, Daniel R.; Kaufman, James S.
AB  - People are exposed to various potentially toxic agents and conditions in their natural and occupational environments. These agents may be physical or chemical, may enter the human body through oral, inhalational, or transdermal routes, and may exert effects on all organ systems. Several well-known as well as lesser known associations exist between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and both environmental agents and conditions, such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals, elevated ambient temperatures, and infections. The effects of these agents may be modulated by genetic susceptibility and other comorbid conditions and may lead to the development of acute and CKD. In this article, we present environmental factors that are associated with CKD. Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Worldwide Impact of Warmer Seasons on the Incidence of Renal Colic and Kidney Stone Disease: Evidence from a Systematic Review of Literature
AU  - Geraghty, Robert M.; Proietti, Silvia; Traxer, Olivier; Archer, Matthew; Somani, Bhaskar K.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several studies have examined the link between temperature or monthly seasonal variations and urolithiasis. The majority of these studies have demonstrated a link between higher ambient monthly temperatures and the incidence of renal colic and kidney stone disease (KSD). However, a worldwide trend on this association has not been explored and we perform a systematic review to examine the effect of seasonal variations on renal colic and KSD., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature for a 26-year period (1990-2017) was conducted on all studies reporting on the effect of seasonal variations and its link to KSD. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from each study, which were analyzed using SPSS version 24., RESULTS: A total of 59 studies were identified, and after screening, 13 were included in this review. The studies ranged in duration from 1 to 9 years (mean: 5.5 years) and included seasonal/monthly variations for proven stones or lithotripsy treatments or emergency department presentations with renal colic. Except for one study, there was a statistically significant association between higher monthly mean temperatures and the incidence of KSD-related events reported from the United Kingdom, South Korea, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, Japan, and New Zealand., CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide trends on the incidence of renal colic and KSD seem be affected by seasonal variation favoring warmer months, with data suggesting that higher ambient temperature has an association with KSD.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis is a worldwide disease with high clinical and economic costs. The increasing incidence in industrialized countries seems to be related to several risk factors, which are partly inherited and partly acquired. Although risk factors in urolithiasis are still under discussion, their identification would provide a notable gain for the patient in terms of stone episodes, and for the health service in terms of costs. This article presents an easy classification of risk factors based on clinical background. Copyright 漏 2007 S. Karger AG.

AU  - Chapman, Evelina; Haby, Michelle M.; Illanes, Eduardo; Sanchez-Viamonte, Julian; Elias, Vanessa; Reveiz, Ludovic
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the potential associations between chronic kidney disease of uncertain or non-traditional etiology (CKDnT) and agrochemicals, heat stress, heavy metals, and other factors identified in the literature in any region of the world and at any time., Methods: This was a systematic review of the most frequent exposures suspected to be possible causes of CKDnT. A search was conducted of PubMed, LILACS, World Wide Science electronic databases, among other sources. Only medium- and high-quality studies were included. The synthesis of evidence included a narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, and meta-regression., Results: Four systematic reviews and 61 primary studies were included. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that exposure to agrochemicals and working in agriculture increase the risk of CKDnT, but this only reached significance for working in agriculture. When cross-sectional studies were excluded, agrochemical exposure became significant. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes., Conclusions: Based on the existing evidence and the precautionary principle, it is important to implement preventive measures to mitigate the damage caused by CKDnT to both agricultural workers and their communities (i.e., improvement of working conditions, cautious management of agrochemicals, etc.). More high-quality research is needed to measure impact and to build the evidence base.

TI  - High ambient temperature and mortality: a review of epidemiologic studies from 2001 to 2008
AU  - Basu, Rupa
AB  - BACKGROUND: This review examines recent evidence on mortality from elevated ambient temperature for studies published from January 2001 to December 2008., METHODS: PubMed was used to search for the following keywords: temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality. The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies. Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations. Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded., RESULTS: Thirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association. The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations. Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld. Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children., CONCLUSION: Many of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study population. Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas, are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.

AB  - The authors conducted a systematic review of the studies of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost because of climate change. The review considered both methodological issues and research results. It found that little is known about DALYs lost because of climate change, except for results based on limited information presented in the World Health Organization (WHO) global-burden-of-disease study in 2002. The measurement of DALYs attributable to climate change presents additional difficulties over measurement of DALYs attributable to other causes. Further studies linking DALYs and climate change should be conducted in various populations and in different ecological regions, including developing countries.

TI  - Environmentally induced, occupational diseases with emphasis on chronic kidney disease of multifactorial origin affecting tropical countries
AU  - Wimalawansa, Shehani A.; Wimalawansa, Sunil J.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmentally induced, occupational diseases are increasing worldwide, especially in rural agricultural communities. Poverty-associated malnutrition, environmental hazards and pollution, and lack of access to clean water, safe sanitation, and modern healthcare facilities are often associated with these chronic illnesses., METHOD: The authors systematically reviewed occupational public health issues that have been related to the environment. General interpretations of results were included as per the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Pertinent publications from research databases were reviewed on (A) the risk-benefits, (B) the prevalence of risk factors for various diseases, (C) the benefits of not ignoring the risk factors (i.e., broader evidence), and (D) the risks, effects, and outcomes of different types of interventions. The authors used chronic kidney disease of multifactorial origin (CKDmfo) as an example to explore the theme. Emphasis was given to the regions with emerging economies and developing countries located in the vicinity of the equator., FINDINGS: Geographical, socio-economic and aetiological similarities exist for many chronic non-communicable diseases that are affecting tropical countries around the equator. The authors identified manufacturing, mining, and agriculture as the biggest polluters of the environment. In addition, deforestation and associated soil erosion, overuse of agrochemicals, and irresponsible factory discharge (e.g., chemicals and paint, from rubber and textile factories, etc.), all contribute to pollution. To decrease the escalating incidences of environmentally induced diseases, governments should work proactively to protect the environment, especially watersheds, and take steps to minimise harmful occupational exposures and strictly enforce environmental regulations., CONCLUSION: Creating public awareness of environmental issues and their relationship to public health is essential. This includes regular monitoring and periodic publication of the quality of water, air and soil; preventing deforestation and man-made soil erosion, increasing forest and ground cover, preventing occupational injuries, judicious and safe use of agrochemicals, sustainable agriculture and development programs, and implementing legislation to protect and conserve water heriage and the environment. These actions are essential both for a healthier environment and for the health of the people who live in that environment. Such measures would also decrease public health threats from such, including global-warming-related erratic environmental changes and the occurrence and the spread of non-communicable diseases, such as CKDmfo.

TI  - Ambient temperature and morbidity: a review of epidemiological evidence
AU  - Ye, Xiaofang; Wolff, Rodney; Yu, Weiwei; Vaneckova, Pavla; Pan, Xiaochuan; Tong, Shilu
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we review the epidemiological evidence on the relationship between ambient temperature and morbidity. We assessed the methodological issues in previous studies and proposed future research directions., DATA SOURCES AND DATA EXTRACTION: We searched the PubMed database for epidemiological studies on ambient temperature and morbidity of noncommunicable diseases published in refereed English journals before 30 June 2010. Forty relevant studies were identified. Of these, 24 examined the relationship between ambient temperature and morbidity, 15 investigated the short-term effects of heat wave on morbidity, and 1 assessed both temperature and heat wave effects., DATA SYNTHESIS: Descriptive and time-series studies were the two main research designs used to investigate the temperature-morbidity relationship. Measurements of temperature exposure and health outcomes used in these studies differed widely. The majority of studies reported a significant relationship between ambient temperature and total or cause-specific morbidities. However, there were some inconsistencies in the direction and magnitude of nonlinear lag effects. The lag effect of hot temperature on morbidity was shorter (several days) compared with that of cold temperature (up to a few weeks). The temperature-morbidity relationship may be confounded or modified by sociodemographic factors and air pollution., CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant short-term effect of ambient temperature on total and cause-specific morbidities. However, further research is needed to determine an appropriate temperature measure, consider a diverse range of morbidities, and to use consistent methodology to make different studies more comparable.

AU  - Wyndham, C. H.; Fellingham, S. A.
AB  - A summary of the literature shows that there are well-marked seasonal variations in mortality for total deaths, for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and for diabetes, the mortality rate being higher in winter than in summer. These seasonal variations in mortality are seen in infants under 1 year of age and in older people but not in youths and young adults. The amplitude of the seasonal variation in mortality increases with increasing age because of the higher incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in older people. Seasonal variations in air temperature are a more important determinant of seasonal variations in respiratory and cardiovascular deaths than are fluctuations in air pollution; there is usually a time-lag of up to a week in the change in air temperature before the mortality rate for these diseases increases; a run of 4 - 5 days of stressful temperatures (either hot or cold) has more effect on mortality than an isolated hot or cold day. Examination of the seasonal variations in all causes of death of the four population groups in South Africa shows that Whites and Asians display the typical pattern of a winter high and a summer low mortality of populations in developed countries. The seasonal variation in mortality of Coloureds and Blacks is quite different. It shows two peaks, one in winter and one in summer. This bimodal pattern in the seasonal variation is due to the fact that one-third of all Coloured and Black deaths occur in infants under 1 year of age and most of these deaths occur in summer as a result of gastro-enteritis. Comparison was made of the seasonal variations in mortality rates for all causes of death and for respiratory and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) deaths of Whites over 40 years of age in Durban and Johannesburg. This showed that the seasonal variation for all causes of death is greater in Johannesburg than in Durban, i.e. proportionately more older Whites die during winter in Johannesburg than in Durban. The reason for this difference is that the seasonal variation in respiratory disease mortality is much greater in Johannesburg than it is in Durban, but the seasonal variation in IHD mortality is the same in the two cities.

TI  - The impact of heat waves on children's health: a systematic review
AU  - Xu, Zhiwei; Sheffield, Perry E.; Su, Hong; Wang, Xiaoyu; Bi, Yan; Tong, Shilu
AB  - Young children are thought to be particularly sensitive to heat waves, but relatively less research attention has been paid to this field to date. A systematic review was conducted to elucidate the relationship between heat waves and children's health. Literature published up to August 2012 were identified using the following MeSH terms and keywords: "heatwave", "heat wave", "child health", "morbidity", "hospital admission", "emergency department visit", "family practice", "primary health care", "death" and "mortality". Of the 628 publications identified, 12 met the selection criteria. The existing literature does not consistently suggest that mortality among children increases significantly during heat waves, even though infants were associated with more heat-related deaths. Exposure to heat waves in the perinatal period may pose a threat to children's health. Pediatric diseases or conditions associated with heat waves include renal disease, respiratory disease, electrolyte imbalance and fever. Future research should focus on how to develop a consistent definition of a heat wave from a children's health perspective, identifying the best measure of children's exposure to heat waves, exploring sensitive outcome measures to quantify the impact of heat waves on children, evaluating the possible impacts of heat waves on children's birth outcomes, and understanding the differences in vulnerability to heat waves among children of different ages and from different income countries. Projection of the children's disease burden caused by heat waves under climate change scenarios, and development of effective heat wave mitigation and adaptation strategies that incorporate other child protective health measures, are also strongly recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present the available evidence on the impacts of climate change on health, to analyze the situation in Spain in relation to the European context, to discuss barriers to and catalysts for climate change, and to recommend policy options to reduce the effects of climate change on health., METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the impact of climate change on health. The proposals for adaptation to climate change identified in the framework of the European project coordinated by the WHO/Europe on "Climate, Environment and Health action plans and information systems" were analyzed., RESULTS: The effects of climate change on health include: 1) an increase in the impacts of extreme weather events; 2) an increase of the frequency of respiratory diseases due to changes in air quality and pollen distribution; 3) an increase in the incidence of food-borne, zoonotic and waterborne diseases; and 4) a change in the distribution of infectious diseases and/or their vectors. In Spain, the morbidity and mortality due to heat waves are expected to increase. The main impact related to atmospheric contamination is a predicted increase in fine particles and ozone. There is also a risk of an increase in the geographical distribution of vector borne diseases that are already established in Spain or the establishment of new subtropical vectors. Spain is one of the first European countries to have developed a climate change adaptation plan. This plan provides a framework for coordination among public institutions on activities to evaluate the impacts of climate change, as well as vulnerability and adaptation to this phenomenon, and makes reference to the health sector., CONCLUSIONS: Policy options to reduce the impacts of climate change on health include: 1) integrating health in all policies, strategies and interventions to mitigate and adapt to climate change; 2) strengthening health systems and public health systems to improve their ability to prevent, prepare and respond to the impacts of climate change; 3) raising awareness among all sectors to promote the co-benefits to health of adaptation and mitigation strategies; and 4) promoting research, technological development, data sharing and information exchange across sectors.

AB  - The prevalence and incidence of nephrolithiasis is reported to be increasing across the world. Herein, we review information regarding stone incidence and prevalence from a global perspective. A literature search using PubMed and Ovid was performed to identify peer-reviewed journal articles containing information on the incidence and prevalence of kidney stones. Key words used included kidney stone prevalence, incidence, and epidemiology. Data were collected from the identified literature and sorted by demographic factors and time period. A total of 75 articles were identified containing kidney stone-related incidence or prevalence data from 20 countries; 34 provided suitable information for review. Data regarding overall prevalence or incidence for more than a single time period were found for 7 countries (incidence data for 4 countries; prevalence data for 5 countries). These included 5 European countries (Italy, Germany, Scotland, Spain, and Sweden), Japan, and the United States. The body of evidence suggests that the incidence and prevalence of kidney stones is increasing globally. These increases are seen across sex, race, and age. Changes in dietary practices may be a key driving force. In addition, global warming may influence these trends.

TI  - Burden of Urolithiasis: Trends in Prevalence, Treatments, and Costs

AB  - Context The recent evolution of management options for urolithiasis has presented a unique dilemma for the modern urologist. A comprehensive understanding of epidemiological trends along with current provider preferences in treating urinary stones would be beneficial. Objective To review trends in the prevalence, treatments, and costs of urolithiasis worldwide. Evidence acquisition A literature review was performed using the MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library Central search facility, Web of Science, and Google Scholar between 1986 and 2016. Keywords used for the search were "urolithiasis" and "prevalence; treatment; and cost". Evidence synthesis The incidence and prevalence of urinary stones are rising around the world, including regions that have historically had low rates of urolithiasis. Common theories explaining this trend involve climate warming, dietary changes, and obesity. Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) has been the preferred mode of treatment since its introduction in the 1980s. However, ureteroscopy (URS) has become increasingly popular for small stones regardless of location because of lower recurrence rates and costs. Developing countries have been slower to adopt URS technology and continue to use percutaneous nephrolithotomy at a steady rate. Conclusions URS has recently challenged SWL as the treatment modality preferred for small upper urinary tract stones. In some cases it is less expensive but still highly effective. As the burden of stone disease increases worldwide, appropriate selection of stone removal therapies will continue to play an important role and will thus require further investigation. Patient summary Urinary stones are becoming more prevalent. Recent advances in technology have improved the management of this disease and have decreased costs.Copyright 漏 2017 European Association of Urology

TI  - Epidemiology of urolithiasis in Asia
AU  - Liu, Yu; Chen, Yuntian; Liao, Banghua; Luo, Deyi; Wang, Kunjie; Li, Hong; Zeng, Guohua
AB  - In Asia, about 1%-19.1% of the population suffer from urolithiasis. However, due to variations in socio-economic status and geographic locations, the prevalence and incidence have changed in different countries or regions over the years. The research for risk factors of urinary tract stones is of predominant importance. In this review, we find the prevalence of urolithiasis is 5%-19.1% in West Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, as well as some developed countries (South Korea and Japan), whereas, it is only 1%-8% in most part of East Asia and North Asia. The recurrence rate ranges from 21% to 53% after 3-5 years. Calcium oxalate (75%-90%) is the most frequent component of calculi, followed by uric acid (5%-20%), calcium phosphate (6%-13%), struvite (2%-15%), apatite (1%) and cystine (0.5%-1%). The incidence of urolithiasis reaches its peak in population aged over 30 years. Males are more likely to suffer from urinary calculi. Because of different dietary habits or genetic background, differences of prevalence among races or nationalities also exist. Genetic mutation of specific locus may contribute to the formation of different kinds of calculi. Dietary habits (westernized dietary habits and less fluid intake), as well as climatic factors (hot temperature and many hours of exposure to sunshine) play a crucial role in the development of stones. Other diseases, especially metabolic syndrome, may also contribute to urinary tract stones.

TI  - The potential impacts of climate variability and change on temperature-related morbidity and mortality in the United States
AU  - McGeehin, M. A.; Mirabelli, M.
AB  - Heat and heat waves are projected to increase in severity and frequency with increasing global mean temperatures. Studies in urban areas show an association between increases in mortality and increases in heat, measured by maximum or minimum temperature, heat index, and sometimes, other weather conditions. Health effects associated with exposure to extreme and prolonged heat appear to be related to environmental temperatures above those to which the population is accustomed. Models of weather-mortality relationships indicate that populations in northeastern and midwestern U.S. cities are likely to experience the greatest number of illnesses and deaths in response to changes in summer temperature. Physiologic and behavioral adaptations may reduce morbidity and mortality. Within heat-sensitive regions, urban populations are the most vulnerable to adverse heat-related health outcomes. The elderly, young children, the poor, and people who are bedridden or are on certain medications are at particular risk. Heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable through behavioral adaptations, including the use of air conditioning and increased fluid intake. Overall death rates are higher in winter than in summer, and it is possible that milder winters could reduce deaths in winter months. However, the relationship between winter weather and mortality is difficult to interpret. Other adaptation measures include heat emergency plans, warning systems, and illness management plans. Research is needed to identify critical weather parameters, the associations between heat and nonfatal illnesses, the evaluation of implemented heat response plans, and the effectiveness of urban design in reducing heat retention.

AU  - McClellan, Ann C.; Plantinga, Laura; McClellan, William M.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Geographic variation in the occurrence and outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is major area of study in epidemiology and health services and outcomes research. Geographic attributes may be as diverse as the physical, socioeconomic, and medical care characteristics of an environment. This review summarizes the recent literature pertaining to geographic risk factors and CKD., RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have reported on the association between CKD and physical attributes of place (ambient temperature and altitude), the impact of disasters on CKD populations, new diseases characterized by regional localization, national variations in CKD incidence and prevalence, regional variation in end-stage renal disease incidence, residential mobility and CKD risk factors, and geographic variations in CKD care. The emerging role of tools for geospatial studies - including multilevel analytical designs, which reduce the likelihood of an ecologically biased inference, and geographic information systems, which allow the simultaneous linkage, analysis, and mapping of geospatial data - is illustrated by these studies., SUMMARY: Our understanding of the occurrence and outcomes of CKD will continue to be expanded and deepened by the explicit study of attributes associated with place as a potential risk factor. Many of the studies reviewed are largely hypothesis generating, and a better understanding of the role of geography in the study of CKD awaits investigations that probe the mechanisms that link attributes of place to disease processes.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of hospital admissions and mortality during heat waves: are deaths from circulatory disease a real excess or an artifact?
AU  - Mastrangelo, Giuseppe; Hajat, Shakoor; Fadda, Emanuela; Buja, Alessandra; Fedeli, Ugo; Spolaore, Paolo
AB  - In old subjects exposed to extreme high temperature during a heat wave, studies have consistently reported an excess of death from cardio- or cerebro-vascular disease. By contrast, dehydration, heat stroke, acute renal insufficiency, and respiratory disease were the main causes of hospital admission in the two studies carried out in elderly during short spells of hot weather. The excess of circulatory disease reported by mortality studies, but not by morbidity studies, could be explained by the hypothesis that deaths from circulatory disease occur rapidly in isolated people before they reach a hospital. Since the contrasting patterns of hospital admission and mortality during heat waves could also be due to chance (random variation over time and space in the spectrum of diseases induced by extreme heat), and bias (poor quality of diagnosis on death certificate and other artifacts), it should be confirmed by a concurrent study of mortality and morbidity. Many heat-related diseases may be preventable with adequate warning and an appropriate response to heat emergencies, but preventive efforts are complicated by the short time interval that may elapse between high temperatures and death. Therefore, prevention programs must be based around rapid identification of high-risk conditions and persons. The effectiveness of the intervention measures must be formally evaluated. If cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases are rapidly fatal health outcomes with a short time interval between exposure to high temperature and death, deaths from circulatory disease might be an useful indicator in evaluating the effectiveness of a heat watch/warning system.

TI  - High temperatures and health outcomes: a review of the literature
AU  - Martiello, Michele Arcangelo; Giacchi, Mariano Vincenzo
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the relationship between high temperatures and population health impacts, in terms of mortality and morbidity., METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Medline to collect data from studies on heat waves, temperature-health impacts curve, risk factors, and preventive measures. All the data collected was published in English and available up to December 2009., RESULTS: Numerous studies carried out in Europe following the 2003 heat wave, as well as those conducted prior to this date in Europe and North America, showed an increase in heat wave-related excess mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated that a forward shift of deaths may only explain a very limited quantity of the excess mortality observed (up to 15%) during major heat waves. Moreover, the results seem to exclude that ozone acts as a confounding variable, whilst it remains a potential effect modifier., CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs to explore the consistency of results in new settings, to quantify the burden of heat-related morbidity and in particular to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented preventive measures.

TI  - [Health effects of heat waves]
AU  - Martiello, Michele Arcangelo; Baldasseroni, Alberto; Buiatti, Eva; Giacchi, Mariano Vincenzo
AB  - Climate change, characterized by increased mean temperatures and more frequent occurrence of extreme temperatures, may lead to adverse health effects through different and complex mechanisms due to substantial changes in the physical and social environment. The most easily measurable health effects of climate change in high-risk groups are the direct effects of excessively high temperatures. A literature review was performed to identify studies regarding heat waves, risk factors and prevention programmes. A large number of studies performed in Europe during the August 2003 heat wave, and previously in both Europe and North America, showed excess mortality during periods of extreme heat. The role of pollution as a confounding factor remains dubious. Groups at risk include the elderly, the urban population, individuals with impaired health and those with low income. Aging of the population (especially in industrialised nations) and increased urbanization (especially in developing countries) may further increase ill health effects of high temperatures.

TI  - Heat stress and public health: a critical review
AU  - Kovats, R. Sari; Hajat, Shakoor
AB  - Heat is an environmental and occupational hazard. The prevention of deaths in the community caused by extreme high temperatures (heat waves) is now an issue of public health concern. The risk of heat-related mortality increases with natural aging, but persons with particular social and/or physical vulnerability are also at risk. Important differences in vulnerability exist between populations, depending on climate, culture, infrastructure (housing), and other factors. Public health measures include health promotion and heat wave warning systems, but the effectiveness of acute measures in response to heat waves has not yet been formally evaluated. Climate change will increase the frequency and the intensity of heat waves, and a range of measures, including improvements to housing, management of chronic diseases, and institutional care of the elderly and the vulnerable, will need to be developed to reduce health impacts.

TI  - The potential effects of climate change on winter mortality in England and Wales
AU  - Langford, I. H.; Bentham, G.
AB  - In Britain death rates from several important causes, particularly circulatory and respiratory diseases, rise markedly during the colder winter months. This close association between temperature and mortality suggests that climate change as a result of global warming may lead to a future reduction in excess winter deaths. This paper gives a brief introductory review of the literature on the links between cold conditions and health, and statistical models are subsequently developed of the associations between temperature and monthly mortality rates for the years 1968 to 1988 for England and Wales. Other factors, particularly the occurrence of influenza epidemics, are also taken into account. Highly significant negative associations were found between temperature and death rates from all causes and from chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. The statistical models developed from this analysis were used to compare death rates for current conditions with those that might be expected to occur in a future warmer climate. The results indicate that the higher temperatures predicted for 2050 might result in nearly 9000 fewer winter deaths each year with the largest contribution being from mortality from ischaemic heart disease. However, these preliminary estimates might change when further research is able to make into account a number of additional factors affecting the relationship between mortality and climate.

AB  - PURPOSE: Older people account for the highest proportion of mortality from extreme weather events associated with climate change. This article aims to describe the health impacts of climate change on older people., TYPE OF STUDY: An integrative review was conducted with 30 studies retrieved from PubMed, EBSCO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) on climate stressors, determinants of resilient capacity, risk factors, and health outcomes., FINDINGS: Heat, temperature variability, and air pollution increase mortality risk in older people, especially from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Floods are linked with increasing incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Facing these adversities, older people exhibit both vulnerability and resilience., CONCLUSIONS: Research gaps exist in understanding the full spectrum of the resilience experience of older people, and appreciating areas wherein nursing can play a pivotal role., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Recognizing the vulnerabilities of older people in the context of climate change is important. Identifying opportunities to promote resilience is an important focus for nurses to develop tailored and targeted nursing interventions. Copyright 漏 2017 Sigma Theta Tau International.

TI  - High Temperatures and Kidney Disease Morbidity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
AU  - Lee, Woo-Seok; Kim, Woo-Sung; Lim, Youn-Hee; Hong, Yun-Chul
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In recent years, serious concerns have been raised regarding the impacts of rising temperatures on health. The present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between elevated temperatures and kidney disease through a systematic review and meta-analysis., METHODS: In October 2017, 2 researchers independently searched related studies in PubMed and Embase. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, including only studies that presented odds ratios, relative risks, or percentage changes, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The characteristics of each study were summarized, and the Egger test and funnel plots were used to evaluate publication bias., RESULTS: Eleven studies that met the criteria were included in the final analysis. The pooled results suggest an increase of 30% (95% CI, 20 to 40) in kidney disease morbidity with high temperatures. In a disease-specific subgroup analysis, statistically significant results were observed for both renal colic or kidney stones and other renal diseases. In a study design-specific subgroup analysis, statistically significant results were observed in both time-series analyses and studies with other designs. In a temperature measure-specific subgroup analysis, significant results were likewise found for both studies using mean temperature measurements and studies measuring heat waves or heat stress., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that morbidity due to kidney disease increases at high temperatures. We also found significant results in subgroup analyses. However, further time-series analyses are needed to obtain more generalizable evidence.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several categories of ill health important at the global level are likely to be affected by climate change. To date the focus of this association has been on communicable diseases and injuries. This paper briefly analyzes potential impacts of global climate change on chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs)., METHOD: We reviewed the limited available evidence of the relationships between climate exposure and chronic and NCDs. We further reviewed likely mechanisms and pathways for climatic influences on chronic disease occurrence and impacts on pre-existing chronic diseases., RESULTS: There are negative impacts of climatic factors and climate change on some physiological functions and on cardio-vascular and kidney diseases. Chronic disease risks are likely to increase with climate change and related increase in air pollution, malnutrition, and extreme weather events., CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial research gaps in this arena. The health sector has a major role in facilitating further research and monitoring the health impacts of global climate change. Such work will also contribute to global efforts for the prevention and control of chronic NCDs in our ageing and urbanizing global population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the effect of temperature on the risk of mortality and the modification effect of latitude, in China., METHODS: Relevant papers were searched and Meta-analysis was used to determine the exposure-response relationship for each health outcome which was associated with the exposure to temperature. Meta-regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect modification by latitude., RESULTS: Ten studies in 15 cities were included in the study. When temperature increased by one centigrade, the risks of mortality showed the following changes:deaths from non-accidental increased by 2% (95%CI:1%, 3%), from cardiovascular disease increased by 4% (95%CI:2%, 6%)and from the respiratory disease increased by 2% (95%CI:1%, 4%). As temperature decreased by one centigrade, the mortality risks of the following diseases showed the changes as: non-accidental death increased by 4% (95% CI:2%, 7%), cardiovascular disease increased by 4% (95%CI:1%, 7%)and the respiratory diseases increased by 2% (95%CI:0%, 4%). When latitude ranged from 0 to 25, 26 to 30, 31 to 39 degree or over 40 degrees, respectively and the temperature decreased by one centigrade, the mortality risks of the general population increased by 6.5% (95%CI:-2.7%, 15.6%), 5.8% (95% CI:2.4%, 9.3%),0.8% (95%CI:0.4%, 1.2%),0.5% (95%CI: -0.5%, 1.5%). As temperature increased by one centigrade, mortality risk of the general population increased by 0.6% (95%CI:-0.3%, 1.4%), 1.9% (95%CI:0.7%, 3.1%), 2.0% (95%CI:1.0%, 3.0%) and 5.8% (95% CI:-3.2%, 14.8%). As latitude increased by five degrees with high temperature, the mortality risk of general people increased by 0.3% (95% CI:0.1% ,0.8%) while decreased by 0.8% (95% CI:0.5%, 0.9%) under low temperature., CONCLUSION: In China, the mortality risk increased along with the changes of temperature. The adaptability to coldness among people living in high latitude areas seemed to be stronger than those living in other areas of latitudes. Who were more vulnerable to high temperature.

TI  - Health effects of milder winters: a review of evidence from the United Kingdom
AU  - Hajat, Shakoor
AB  - Cold-related mortality and morbidity remains an important public health problem in the UK and elsewhere. Health burdens have often reported to be higher in the UK compared to other countries with colder climates, however such assessments are usually based on comparison of excess winter mortality indices, which are subject to biases. Daily time-series regression or case-crossover studies provide the best evidence of the acute effects of cold exposure. Such studies report a 6% increase in all-cause deaths in England & Wales for every 1 degreeC fall in daily mean temperature within the top 5% of the coldest days. In major Scottish cities, a 1 degreeC reduction in mean temperature below 11 degreeC was associated with an increase in mortality of 2.9%, 3.4%, 4.8% and 1.7% from all-causes, cardiovascular, respiratory, and non-cardio-respiratory causes respectively. In Northern Ireland, a 1 degreeC fall during winter months led to increases of 4.5%, 3.9% and 11.2% for all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory deaths respectively among adults. Raised risks are also observed with morbidity outcomes. Hip fractures among the elderly are only weakly associated with snow and ice conditions in the UK, with the majority of cases occurring indoors. A person's susceptibility to cold weather is affected by both individual- and contextual-level risk factors. Variations in the distributions of health, demographic, socio-economic and built-environment characteristics are likely to explain most differences in cold risk observed between UK regions. Although cold-related health impacts reduced throughout much of the previous century in UK populations, there is little evidence on the contribution that milder winters due to climate change may have made to reductions in more recent decades. Intervention measures designed to minimise cold exposure and reduce fuel poverty will likely play a key role in determining current and future health burdens associated with cold weather.

TI  - Ambient temperature as a contributor to kidney stone formation: implications of global warming
AU  - Fakheri, Robert J.; Goldfarb, David S.
AB  - Nephrolithiasis is a common disease across the world that is becoming more prevalent. Although the underlying cause for most stones is not known, a body of literature suggests a role of heat and climate as significant risk factors for lithogenesis. Recently, estimates from computer models predicted up to a 10% increase in the prevalence rate in the next half century secondary to the effects of global warming, with a coinciding 25% increase in health-care expenditures. Our aim here is to critically review the medical literature relating stones to ambient temperature. We have categorized the body of evidence by methodology, consisting of comparisons between geographic regions, comparisons over time, and comparisons between people in specialized environments. Although most studies are confounded by other factors like sunlight exposure and regional variation in diet that share some contribution, it appears that heat does play a role in pathogenesis in certain populations. Notably, the role of heat is much greater in men than in women. We also hypothesize that the role of a significant human migration (from rural areas to warmer, urban locales beginning in the last century and projected to continue) may have a greater impact than global warming on the observed worldwide increasing prevalence rate of nephrolithiasis. At this time the limited data available cannot substantiate this proposed mechanism but further studies to investigate this effect are warranted.

This is the first narrative review of studies on heat wave-associated mortality in Germany. The review and critical evaluation includes 12 studies. Notable differences in the research methodology were observed. Scientific knowledge on heat wave-associated mortality in Germany is insufficient. So far, most studies have focused on large cities or states/provinces. However, risk assessments play an important role in deciding upon and planning of preventive measures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Climate change and rapid population ageing are significant public health challenges. Understanding which health problems are affected by temperature is important for preventing heat and cold-related deaths and illnesses, particularly in the elderly. Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ambient hot and cold temperature (excluding heat/cold wave only studies) on elderly (65+ years) mortality and morbidity., METHODS: Time-series or case-crossover studies comprising cause-specific cases of elderly mortality (n=3,933,398) or morbidity (n=12,157,782) were pooled to obtain a percent change (%) in risk for temperature exposure on cause-specific disease outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis., RESULTS: A 1degreeC temperature rise increased cardiovascular (3.44%, 95% CI 3.10-3.78), respiratory (3.60%, 3.18-4.02), and cerebrovascular (1.40%, 0.06-2.75) mortality. A 1degreeC temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.84-3.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.19-2.14) mortality. The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 20-12.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.54-8.44). A 1degreeC temperature rise increased cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary, infectious disease and heat-related morbidity., DISCUSSION: Elevated risks for the elderly were prominent for temperature-induced cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, diabetes, genitourinary, infectious disease, heat-related, and respiratory outcomes. These risks will likely increase with climate change and global ageing. Copyright 漏 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Development of national evidence-based public health strategies requires a deep understanding of the role of major risk factors (RFs) and the burden of disease (BOD). In this article, we explain the framework for studying the national and sub-national Environmental Burden of Disease (EBD) in Iran as a part of the National and Sub-national Burden of Disease (NASBOD) study. METHODS: The distribution of exposures to environmental RFs and their attributable effect size over 1990-2013 will be estimated through comprehensive reviews of either published or unpublished sources. Statistical modeling will be used to impute missing data in the distribution of RFs exposures for each district-year. National and sub-national BOD attributable to these RFs will be estimated in the following metrics: Prevalance, death, years of life lost due to premature death (YLL), years of life lost due to disability (YLD), and disability -adjusted life years last (DALYS). The BOD attributable to the current distribution of exposures will be compared with a counterfactual exposure distribution scenario-here, the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure distribution. Inequalities in the distribution of exposure to RFs will be analyzed and manifested nationwide using geographic information systems. DISCUSSION: The EBD study aims to provide an official report to Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education, to publish a series of articles on the exposure trends of the selected environmental RFs, to estimate the BOD attributable to these RFs, and to assess inequalities and its determinants in the distribution of exposure to RFs. Iran's territory is large with diverse population, socioeconomic, and geographic areas. Results of this comparative risk assessment study may pave the way for health policy makers to plan more comprehensive and cost-effective evidence-based strategies.

TI  - Temperature-related morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review of the empirical evidence
AU  - Amegah, A. Kofi; Rezza, Giovanni; Jaakkola, Jouni J. K.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) contributes very little to overall climate change and yet it is estimated to bear the highest burden of climate change, with 34% of the global DALYs attributable to the effects of climate change found in SSA. With the exception of vector-borne diseases, particularly malaria, there is very limited research on human health effects of climate change in SSA, in spite of growing awareness of the region's vulnerability to climate change., OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to systematically review all studies investigating temperature variability and non-vector borne morbidity and mortality in SSA to establish the state and quality of available evidence, identify gaps in knowledge, and propose future research priorities., METHODS: PubMed, Ovid Medline and Scopus were searched from their inception to the end of December 2014. We modified the GRADE guidelines to rate the quality of the body of evidence., RESULTS: Of 6745 studies screened, 23 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Moderate evidence exists to associate temperature variability with cholera outbreaks, cardiovascular disease hospitalization and deaths, and all-cause deaths in the region. The quality of evidence on child undernutrition is low, and for diarrhea occurrence, meningitis, Ebola, asthma and respiratory diseases, and skin diseases, very low., CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base is somehow weakened by the limited number of studies uncovered, methodological limitations of the studies, and notable inconsistencies in the study findings. Further research with robust study designs and standardized analytical methods is thus needed to produce more credible evidence base to inform climate change preparedness plans and public health policies for improved adaptive capacity in SSA. Investment in meteorological services, and strengthening of health information systems is also required to guarantee timely, up-to-date and reliable data. Copyright 漏 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The health effects of hotter summers and heat waves in the population of the United Kingdom: a review of the evidence
AU  - Arbuthnott, Katherine G.; Hajat, Shakoor
AB  - It is widely acknowledged that the climate is warming globally and within the UK. In this paper, studies which assess the direct impact of current increased temperatures and heat-waves on health and those which project future health impacts of heat under different climate change scenarios in the UK are reviewed.This review finds that all UK studies demonstrate an increase in heat-related mortality occurring at temperatures above threshold values, with respiratory deaths being more sensitive to heat than deaths from cardiovascular disease (although the burden from cardiovascular deaths is greater in absolute terms). The relationship between heat and other health outcomes such as hospital admissions, myocardial infarctions and birth outcomes is less consistent. We highlight the main populations who are vulnerable to heat. Within the UK, these are older populations, those with certain co-morbidities and those living in Greater London, the South East and Eastern regions.In all assessments of heat-related impacts using different climate change scenarios, deaths are expected to increase due to hotter temperatures, with some studies demonstrating that an increase in the elderly population will also amplify burdens. However, key gaps in knowledge are found in relation to how urbanisation and population adaptation to heat will affect health impacts, and in relation to current and future strategies for effective, sustainable and equitable adaptation to heat. These and other key gaps in knowledge, both in terms of research needs and knowledge required to make sound public- health policy, are discussed.

TI  - Epidemiology and risk factors in urolithiasis
AU  - Bartoletti, R.; Cai, T.; Mondaini, N.; Melone, F.; Travaglini, F.; Carini, M.; Rizzo, M.
AB  - Stone formation in the urinary tract affects about 5-10% of the population in industrialized countries, although it is very rare in other countries such as Greenland or Japan. The high incidence and recurrence rate contribute to making the urolithiasis a serious social problem. Nowadays, urolithiasis must be considered a 'disease in evolution' for several reasons, such as epidemiological changes, evolution of the methods used for diagnosis, and the treatment and prophylaxis of the population considered 'at risk' of stone disease. Some features of stone disease have changed over the last few years due to many social, economical and cultural factors that are described here. The increased prevalence of small urinary calculi has brought about a change in clinical symptoms, with frequent episodes of renal-ureteral colic, persistent pain and hydronephrosis. Similarly, the presence of residual fragments after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has induced a radical change in the management of small calculi through the use of mini-invasive surgical techniques.

TI  - Modeling the distribution of urolithiasis prevalence under projected climate change in Iran
AU  - Shajari, Ahmad; Sanjerehei, Mohammad Mousaei
AB  - Although studies support a positive correlation between temperature and stone risk, the precise relationship between these factors has not been elucidated. We modeled the current distribution of urolithiasis prevalence in Iran using 26 bioclimatic, climatic and topographic variables based on two multivariate linear regression models in geographical information system. The impact of climate change on the stone prevalence was predicted under the projections of GFDL-ESM2G, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES climate models by mid-century (2050). Extraterrestrial radiation and isothermality in the first regression model and annual mean temperature, precipitation seasonality and isothermality in the second model were the significant (P<0.01) predictors of urolithiasis prevalence. Both regression models provided good estimates of the stone prevalence (R2>0.9) and determined a mean urolithiasis prevalence of 6% (range of 1.5-10.8%) in Iran. The climate change under the projections of GFDL-ESM2G, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES models can, respectively, lead to an average increase of 5.7, 4.3 and 9% in the urolithiasis prevalence based on the second regression model by 2050. The highest increase of the prevalence will occur in the west, northwest and southwest provinces of the country. Predicting the impact of climate change on climate-related diseases can be useful for effective preventive measures.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease screening methods and its implication for Malaysia: an in depth review
AU  - Almualm, Yasmin; Zaman Huri, Hasniza
AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease has become a public health problem, imposing heath, social and human cost on societies worldwide. Chronic Kidney Disease remains asymptomatic till late stage when intervention cannot stop the progression of the disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to detect the disease early. Despite the high prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease in Malaysia, screening is still lacking behind. This review discusses the strengths and limitations of current screening methods for Chronic Kidney Disease from a Malaysian point of view. Diabetic Kidney Disease was chosen as focal point as Diabetes is the leading cause of Chronic Kidney Disease in Malaysia. Screening for Chronic Kidney Disease in Malaysia includes a urine test for albuminuria and a blood test for serum creatinine. Recent literature indicates that albuminuria is not always present in Diabetic Kidney Disease patients and serum creatinine is only raised after substantial kidney damage has occurred. Recently, cystatin C was proposed as a potential marker for kidney disease but this has not been studied thoroughly in Malaysia. Glomerular Filtration Rate is the best method for measuring kidney function and is widely estimated using the Modification of Diet for Renal Disease equation. Another equation, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Creatinine equation was introduced in 2009. The new equation retained the precision and accuracy of the Modification of Diet for Renal Disease equation at GFR < 60ml/min/1.73m2, showed less bias and improved precision at GFR>60ml/min/1.73m2. In Asian countries, adding an ethnic coefficient to the equation enhanced its performance. In Malaysia, a multi-ethnic Asian population, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation should be validated and the Glomerular Filtration Rate should be reported whenever serum creatinine is ordered. Reporting estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate will help diagnose patients who would have been otherwise missed if only albuminuria and serum creatinine are measured.

TI  - Urolithiasis in adults. Clinical and biochemical aspects
AU  - Abdel-Halim, R. E.
AB  - Urolithiasis is a multifactorial recurrent disease of world-wide distribution in rural, urban, industrial and non-industrial regions. Changes in urinary pH is a risk factor especially with hyperuricosuria, hypercalciuria or hyperoxaluria. With recurrence, hypercalcuria and higher urinary oxalate levels are more frequent. Hypercalciuria and hyperuricosuria showed correlation with family history of stones. The ionic relations between various stone forming salts in urine of patients are opposite to that in controls and are well represented in stone composition. Obesity is a risk factor in both genders. Over eating a diet rich in all nutrients was associated with hyperuricosuria while a diet high only in fat was associated with other urinary disturbances. High protein and fat intake are risk factors. High or low calcium diet was associated with urolithiasis and supplemental calcium is not a risk factor. Potassium and magnesium citrate are potent in inhibiting the growth of stone fragments after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Whether in patients or normal subjects, drinking hard water should be avoided; tap water or low calcium content water is preferable. Seasonal variations in temperature affected urinary volume, pH and relative saturation of uric acid. To prevent recurrence, patients should maintain high fluid intake achieving a urine volume of 2 liters per day.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of urolithiasis has increased in both the developed and the developing countries during the past decades. Economically, the increase of urolithiasis contributes to the rise of the healthcare burden everywhere. Moreover, this increase has been associated with a change in the epidemiology of urolithiasis in terms of age and sex distribution, and also the location and type of calculi., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE for relevant literature dating back to 1980. This review compared the trends in epidemiological factors affecting urolithiasis in the developed and the developing countries during the past decades., RESULTS: People in the developing countries are more likely to contract kidney calculi at a younger age than in the developed countries. Although calculus disease is still more prevalent in men than in women, the latter are increasingly affected in both worlds. Uric acid calculi are more prevalent in the developing than in industrialized countries. There is a progressive increase in the frequency of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate calculi in the developing countries where these used to be less frequent., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of urinary calculi is increasing globally. Many factors including aging of the population, changes in diet, global warming, and employment of more accurate diagnostic tools seem to be involved in this increase. An increasing affluence and adaptation of Western diet habits in many developing countries seem likely to contribute to the changes.

TI  - Assessing Heat Stress and Health among Construction Workers in a Changing Climate: A Review
AU  - Acharya, Payel; Boggess, Bethany; Zhang, Kai
AB  - Construction workers are at an elevated risk of heat stress, due to the strenuous nature of the work, high temperature work condition, and a changing climate. An increasing number of workers are at risk, as the industry's growth has been fueled by high demand and vast numbers of immigrant workers entering into the U.S., the Middle East and Asia to meet the demand. The risk of heat-related illnesses is increased by the fact that little to no regulations are present and/or enforced to protect these workers. This review recognizes the issues by summarizing epidemiological studies both in the U.S. and internationally. These studies have assessed the severity with which construction workers are affected by heat stress, risk factors and co-morbidities associated with heat-related illnesses in the construction industry, vulnerable populations, and efforts in implementing preventive measures.

AU  - Abd Elhafeez, S.; Bolignano, D.; D'Arrigo, G.; Dounousi, E.; Tripepi, G.; Zoccali, C.
AB  - Objectives While increasing attention is paid to the rising prevalence of chronic diseases in Africa, there is little focus on chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review assesses CKD burden among the general population and high-risk groups on the entire African continent. Design, setting and participants We searched Medline and PubMed databases for articles published between 1 January 1995 and 7 April 2017 by sensitive search strategies focusing on CKD surveys at the community level and high-risk groups. In total, 7918 references were evaluated, of which 7766 articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thus, 152 studies were included in the final analysis. Outcome measurement The prevalence of CKD in each study group was expressed as a range and pooled prevalence rate of CKD was calculated as a point estimate and 95% CI. No meta-analysis was done. Data were presented for different populations. Results In the community-level studies, based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies, the prevalence of CKD ranged from 2% to 41% (pooled prevalence: 10.1%; 95% CI 9.8% to 10.5%). The prevalence of CKD in the high-risk groups ranged from 1% to 46% (pooled prevalence: 5.6%; 95% CI 5.4% to 5.8%) in patients with HIV (based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies), 11%-90% (pooled prevalence: 24.7%; 95% CI 23.6% to 25.7%) in patients with diabetes (based on all available studies which are of low quality except four of medium quality) and 13%-51% (pooled prevalence: 34.5%; 95 % CI 34.04% to 36%) in patients with hypertension (based on all available studies which are of low quality except two of medium quality). Conclusion In Africa, CKD is a public health problem, mainly attributed to high-risk conditions as hypertension and diabetes. The poor data quality restricts the validity of the findings and draws the attention to the importance of designing future robust studies.Copyright 漏 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

TI  - Changes in population susceptibility to heat and cold over time: assessing adaptation to climate change
AU  - Arbuthnott, Katherine; Hajat, Shakoor; Heaviside, Clare; Vardoulakis, Sotiris
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of a warming climate and increasing urbanisation (with the associated urban heat island effect), interest in understanding temperature related health effects is growing. Previous reviews have examined how the temperature-mortality relationship varies by geographical location. There have been no reviews examining the empirical evidence for changes in population susceptibility to the effects of heat and/or cold over time. The objective of this paper is to review studies which have specifically examined variations in temperature related mortality risks over the 20(th) and 21(st) centuries and determine whether population adaptation to heat and/or cold has occurred., METHODS: We searched five electronic databases combining search terms for three main concepts: temperature, health outcomes and changes in vulnerability or adaptation. Studies included were those which quantified the risk of heat related mortality with changing ambient temperature in a specific location over time, or those which compared mortality outcomes between two different extreme temperature events (heatwaves) in one location., RESULTS: The electronic searches returned 9183 titles and abstracts, of which eleven studies examining the effects of ambient temperature over time were included and six studies comparing the effect of different heatwaves at discrete time points were included. Of the eleven papers that quantified the risk of, or absolute heat related mortality over time, ten found a decrease in susceptibility over time of which five found the decrease to be significant. The magnitude of the decrease varied by location. Only two studies attempted to quantitatively attribute changes in susceptibility to specific adaptive measures and found no significant association between the risk of heat related mortality and air conditioning prevalence within or between cities over time. Four of the six papers examining effects of heatwaves found a decrease in expected mortality in later years. Five studies examined the risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related mortality in later time periods., CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that across a number of different settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk. A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown. Adaptation to heat has implications for future planning, particularly in urban areas, with anticipated increases in temperature due to climate change.

AB  - People are exposed to various potentially toxic agents and conditions in their natural and occupational environments. These agents may be physical or chemical, may enter the human body through oral, inhalational, or transdermal routes, and may exert effects on all organ systems. Several well-known as well as lesser known associations exist between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and both environmental agents and conditions, such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals, elevated ambient temperatures, and infections. The effects of these agents may be modulated by genetic susceptibility and other comorbid conditions and may lead to the development of acute and CKD.

TI  - Worldwide Impact of Warmer Seasons on the Incidence of Renal Colic and Kidney Stone Disease: Evidence from a Systematic Review of Literature
AU  - Geraghty, Robert M.; Proietti, Silvia; Traxer, Olivier; Archer, Matthew; Somani, Bhaskar K.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several studies have examined the link between temperature or monthly seasonal variations and urolithiasis. The majority of these studies have demonstrated a link between higher ambient monthly temperatures and the incidence of renal colic and kidney stone disease (KSD). However, a worldwide trend on this association has not been explored and we perform a systematic review to examine the effect of seasonal variations on renal colic and KSD., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature for a 26-year period (1990-2017) was conducted on all studies reporting on the effect of seasonal variations and its link to KSD. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from each study, which were analyzed using SPSS version 24., RESULTS: A total of 59 studies were identified, and after screening, 13 were included in this review. The studies ranged in duration from 1 to 9 years (mean: 5.5 years) and included seasonal/monthly variations for proven stones or lithotripsy treatments or emergency department presentations with renal colic. Except for one study, there was a statistically significant association between higher monthly mean temperatures and the incidence of KSD-related events reported from the United Kingdom, South Korea, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, Japan, and New Zealand., CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide trends on the incidence of renal colic and KSD seem be affected by seasonal variation favoring warmer months, with data suggesting that higher ambient temperature has an association with KSD.

AU  - Chapman, Evelina; Haby, Michelle M.; Illanes, Eduardo; Sanchez-Viamonte, Julian; Elias, Vanessa; Reveiz, Ludovic
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the potential associations between chronic kidney disease of uncertain or non-traditional etiology (CKDnT) and agrochemicals, heat stress, heavy metals, and other factors identified in the literature in any region of the world and at any time., Methods: This was a systematic review of the most frequent exposures suspected to be possible causes of CKDnT. A search was conducted of PubMed, LILACS, World Wide Science electronic databases, among other sources. Only medium- and high-quality studies were included. The synthesis of evidence included a narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, and meta-regression., Results: Four systematic reviews and 61 primary studies were included. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that exposure to agrochemicals and working in agriculture increase the risk of CKDnT, but this only reached significance for working in agriculture. When cross-sectional studies were excluded, agrochemical exposure became significant. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes., Conclusions: Based on the existing evidence and the precautionary principle, it is important to implement preventive measures to mitigate the damage caused by CKDnT to both agricultural workers and their communities (i.e., improvement of working conditions, cautious management of agrochemicals, etc.). More high-quality research is needed to measure impact and to build the evidence base.

TI  - High ambient temperature and mortality: a review of epidemiologic studies from 2001 to 2008
AU  - Basu, Rupa
AB  - BACKGROUND: This review examines recent evidence on mortality from elevated ambient temperature for studies published from January 2001 to December 2008., METHODS: PubMed was used to search for the following keywords: temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality. The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies. Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations. Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded., RESULTS: Thirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association. The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations. Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld. Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children., CONCLUSION: Many of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study population. Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas, are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.

TI  - Prevalence and burden of chronic kidney disease among the general population and high-risk groups in Africa: A systematic review
AU  - Abd Elhafeez, S.; Bolignano, D.; D'Arrigo, G.; Dounousi, E.; Tripepi, G.; Zoccali, C.
AB  - Objectives While increasing attention is paid to the rising prevalence of chronic diseases in Africa, there is little focus on chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review assesses CKD burden among the general population and high-risk groups on the entire African continent. Design, setting and participants We searched Medline and PubMed databases for articles published between 1 January 1995 and 7 April 2017 by sensitive search strategies focusing on CKD surveys at the community level and high-risk groups. In total, 7918 references were evaluated, of which 7766 articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thus, 152 studies were included in the final analysis. Outcome measurement The prevalence of CKD in each study group was expressed as a range and pooled prevalence rate of CKD was calculated as a point estimate and 95% CI. No meta-analysis was done. Data were presented for different populations. Results In the community-level studies, based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies, the prevalence of CKD ranged from 2% to 41% (pooled prevalence: 10.1%; 95% CI 9.8% to 10.5%). The prevalence of CKD in the high-risk groups ranged from 1% to 46% (pooled prevalence: 5.6%; 95% CI 5.4% to 5.8%) in patients with HIV (based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies), 11%-90% (pooled prevalence: 24.7%; 95% CI 23.6% to 25.7%) in patients with diabetes (based on all available studies which are of low quality except four of medium quality) and 13%-51% (pooled prevalence: 34.5%; 95 % CI 34.04% to 36%) in patients with hypertension (based on all available studies which are of low quality except two of medium quality). Conclusion In Africa, CKD is a public health problem, mainly attributed to high-risk conditions as hypertension and diabetes. The poor data quality restricts the validity of the findings and draws the attention to the importance of designing future robust studies.Copyright 漏 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

TI  - Changes in population susceptibility to heat and cold over time: assessing adaptation to climate change
AU  - Arbuthnott, Katherine; Hajat, Shakoor; Heaviside, Clare; Vardoulakis, Sotiris
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of a warming climate and increasing urbanisation (with the associated urban heat island effect), interest in understanding temperature related health effects is growing. Previous reviews have examined how the temperature-mortality relationship varies by geographical location. There have been no reviews examining the empirical evidence for changes in population susceptibility to the effects of heat and/or cold over time. The objective of this paper is to review studies which have specifically examined variations in temperature related mortality risks over the 20(th) and 21(st) centuries and determine whether population adaptation to heat and/or cold has occurred., METHODS: We searched five electronic databases combining search terms for three main concepts: temperature, health outcomes and changes in vulnerability or adaptation. Studies included were those which quantified the risk of heat related mortality with changing ambient temperature in a specific location over time, or those which compared mortality outcomes between two different extreme temperature events (heatwaves) in one location., RESULTS: The electronic searches returned 9183 titles and abstracts, of which eleven studies examining the effects of ambient temperature over time were included and six studies comparing the effect of different heatwaves at discrete time points were included. Of the eleven papers that quantified the risk of, or absolute heat related mortality over time, ten found a decrease in susceptibility over time of which five found the decrease to be significant. The magnitude of the decrease varied by location. Only two studies attempted to quantitatively attribute changes in susceptibility to specific adaptive measures and found no significant association between the risk of heat related mortality and air conditioning prevalence within or between cities over time. Four of the six papers examining effects of heatwaves found a decrease in expected mortality in later years. Five studies examined the risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related mortality in later time periods., CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that across a number of different settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk. A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown. Adaptation to heat has implications for future planning, particularly in urban areas, with anticipated increases in temperature due to climate change.

AU  - Soderland, Peter; Lovekar, Shachi; Weiner, Daniel E.; Brooks, Daniel R.; Kaufman, James S.
AB  - People are exposed to various potentially toxic agents and conditions in their natural and occupational environments. These agents may be physical or chemical, may enter the human body through oral, inhalational, or transdermal routes, and may exert effects on all organ systems. Several well-known as well as lesser known associations exist between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and both environmental agents and conditions, such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals, elevated ambient temperatures, and infections. The effects of these agents may be modulated by genetic susceptibility and other comorbid conditions and may lead to the development of acute and CKD. In this article, we present environmental factors that are associated with CKD. Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Worldwide Impact of Warmer Seasons on the Incidence of Renal Colic and Kidney Stone Disease: Evidence from a Systematic Review of Literature
AU  - Geraghty, Robert M.; Proietti, Silvia; Traxer, Olivier; Archer, Matthew; Somani, Bhaskar K.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several studies have examined the link between temperature or monthly seasonal variations and urolithiasis. The majority of these studies have demonstrated a link between higher ambient monthly temperatures and the incidence of renal colic and kidney stone disease (KSD). However, a worldwide trend on this association has not been explored and we perform a systematic review to examine the effect of seasonal variations on renal colic and KSD., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature for a 26-year period (1990-2017) was conducted on all studies reporting on the effect of seasonal variations and its link to KSD. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from each study, which were analyzed using SPSS version 24., RESULTS: A total of 59 studies were identified, and after screening, 13 were included in this review. The studies ranged in duration from 1 to 9 years (mean: 5.5 years) and included seasonal/monthly variations for proven stones or lithotripsy treatments or emergency department presentations with renal colic. Except for one study, there was a statistically significant association between higher monthly mean temperatures and the incidence of KSD-related events reported from the United Kingdom, South Korea, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, Japan, and New Zealand., CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide trends on the incidence of renal colic and KSD seem be affected by seasonal variation favoring warmer months, with data suggesting that higher ambient temperature has an association with KSD.

AB  - Nephrolithiasis is a worldwide disease with high clinical and economic costs. The increasing incidence in industrialized countries seems to be related to several risk factors, which are partly inherited and partly acquired. Although risk factors in urolithiasis are still under discussion, their identification would provide a notable gain for the patient in terms of stone episodes, and for the health service in terms of costs. This article presents an easy classification of risk factors based on clinical background. Copyright 漏 2007 S. Karger AG.

AU  - Chapman, Evelina; Haby, Michelle M.; Illanes, Eduardo; Sanchez-Viamonte, Julian; Elias, Vanessa; Reveiz, Ludovic
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the potential associations between chronic kidney disease of uncertain or non-traditional etiology (CKDnT) and agrochemicals, heat stress, heavy metals, and other factors identified in the literature in any region of the world and at any time., Methods: This was a systematic review of the most frequent exposures suspected to be possible causes of CKDnT. A search was conducted of PubMed, LILACS, World Wide Science electronic databases, among other sources. Only medium- and high-quality studies were included. The synthesis of evidence included a narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, and meta-regression., Results: Four systematic reviews and 61 primary studies were included. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that exposure to agrochemicals and working in agriculture increase the risk of CKDnT, but this only reached significance for working in agriculture. When cross-sectional studies were excluded, agrochemical exposure became significant. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes., Conclusions: Based on the existing evidence and the precautionary principle, it is important to implement preventive measures to mitigate the damage caused by CKDnT to both agricultural workers and their communities (i.e., improvement of working conditions, cautious management of agrochemicals, etc.). More high-quality research is needed to measure impact and to build the evidence base.

TI  - Modeling the distribution of urolithiasis prevalence under projected climate change in Iran
AU  - Shajari, Ahmad; Sanjerehei, Mohammad Mousaei
AB  - Although studies support a positive correlation between temperature and stone risk, the precise relationship between these factors has not been elucidated. We modeled the current distribution of urolithiasis prevalence in Iran using 26 bioclimatic, climatic and topographic variables based on two multivariate linear regression models in geographical information system. The impact of climate change on the stone prevalence was predicted under the projections of GFDL-ESM2G, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES climate models by mid-century (2050). Extraterrestrial radiation and isothermality in the first regression model and annual mean temperature, precipitation seasonality and isothermality in the second model were the significant (P<0.01) predictors of urolithiasis prevalence. Both regression models provided good estimates of the stone prevalence (R2>0.9) and determined a mean urolithiasis prevalence of 6% (range of 1.5-10.8%) in Iran. The climate change under the projections of GFDL-ESM2G, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES models can, respectively, lead to an average increase of 5.7, 4.3 and 9% in the urolithiasis prevalence based on the second regression model by 2050. The highest increase of the prevalence will occur in the west, northwest and southwest provinces of the country. Predicting the impact of climate change on climate-related diseases can be useful for effective preventive measures.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease screening methods and its implication for Malaysia: an in depth review
AU  - Almualm, Yasmin; Zaman Huri, Hasniza
AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease has become a public health problem, imposing heath, social and human cost on societies worldwide. Chronic Kidney Disease remains asymptomatic till late stage when intervention cannot stop the progression of the disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to detect the disease early. Despite the high prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease in Malaysia, screening is still lacking behind. This review discusses the strengths and limitations of current screening methods for Chronic Kidney Disease from a Malaysian point of view. Diabetic Kidney Disease was chosen as focal point as Diabetes is the leading cause of Chronic Kidney Disease in Malaysia. Screening for Chronic Kidney Disease in Malaysia includes a urine test for albuminuria and a blood test for serum creatinine. Recent literature indicates that albuminuria is not always present in Diabetic Kidney Disease patients and serum creatinine is only raised after substantial kidney damage has occurred. Recently, cystatin C was proposed as a potential marker for kidney disease but this has not been studied thoroughly in Malaysia. Glomerular Filtration Rate is the best method for measuring kidney function and is widely estimated using the Modification of Diet for Renal Disease equation. Another equation, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Creatinine equation was introduced in 2009. The new equation retained the precision and accuracy of the Modification of Diet for Renal Disease equation at GFR < 60ml/min/1.73m2, showed less bias and improved precision at GFR>60ml/min/1.73m2. In Asian countries, adding an ethnic coefficient to the equation enhanced its performance. In Malaysia, a multi-ethnic Asian population, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation should be validated and the Glomerular Filtration Rate should be reported whenever serum creatinine is ordered. Reporting estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate will help diagnose patients who would have been otherwise missed if only albuminuria and serum creatinine are measured.

TI  - What is cold-related mortality? A multi-disciplinary perspective to inform climate change impact assessments
AU  - Arbuthnott, Katherine; Hajat, Shakoor; Heaviside, Clare; Vardoulakis, Sotiris
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing discussion regarding the mortality burdens of hot and cold weather and how the balance between these may alter as a result of climate change. Net effects of climate change are often presented, and in some settings these may suggest that reductions in cold-related mortality will outweigh increases in heat-related mortality. However, key to these discussions is that the magnitude of temperature-related mortality is wholly sensitive to the placement of the temperature threshold above or below which effects are modelled. For cold exposure especially, where threshold effects are often ill-defined, choices in threshold placement have varied widely between published studies, even within the same location. Despite this, there is little discussion around appropriate threshold selection and whether reported associations reflect true causal relationships - i.e. whether all deaths occurring below a given temperature threshold can be regarded as cold-related and are therefore likely to decrease as climate warms., OBJECTIVES: Our objectives are to initiate a discussion around the importance of threshold placement and examine evidence for causality across the full range of temperatures used to quantify cold-related mortality. We examine whether understanding causal mechanisms can inform threshold selection, the interpretation of current and future cold-related health burdens and their use in policy formation., METHODS: Using Greater London data as an example, we first illustrate the sensitivity of cold related mortality to threshold selection. Using the Bradford Hill criteria as a framework, we then integrate knowledge and evidence from multiple disciplines and areas- including animal and human physiology, epidemiology, biomarker studies and population level studies. This allows for discussion of several possible direct and indirect causal mechanisms operating across the range of 'cold' temperatures and lag periods used in health impact studies, and whether this in turn can inform appropriate threshold placement., RESULTS: Evidence from a range of disciplines appears to support a causal relationship for cold across a range of temperatures and lag periods, although there is more consistent evidence for a causal effect at more extreme temperatures. It is plausible that 'direct' mechanisms for cold mortality are likely to occur at lower temperatures and 'indirect' mechanisms (e.g. via increased spread of infection) may occur at milder temperatures., CONCLUSIONS: Separating the effects of 'extreme' and 'moderate' cold (e.g. temperatures between approximately 8-9degreeC and 18degreeC in the UK) could help the interpretation of studies quoting attributable mortality burdens. However there remains the general dilemma of whether it is better to use a lower cold threshold below which we are more certain of a causal relationship, but at the risk of under-estimating deaths attributable to cold.

TI  - Projection of temperature-related mortality due to cardiovascular disease in beijing under different climate change, population, and adaptation scenarios
AU  - Zhang, Boya; Li, Guoxing; Ma, Yue; Pan, Xiaochuan
AB  - Human health faces unprecedented challenges caused by climate change. Thus, studies of the effect of temperature change on total mortality have been conducted in numerous countries. However, few of those studies focused on temperature-related mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) or considered future population changes and adaptation to climate change. We present herein a projection of temperature-related mortality due to CVD under different climate change, population, and adaptation scenarios in Beijing, a megacity in China. To this end, 19 global circulation models (GCMs), 3 representative concentration pathways (RCPs), 3 socioeconomic pathways, together with generalized linear models and distributed lag non-linear models, were used to project future temperature-related CVD mortality during periods centered around the years 2050 and 2070. The number of temperature-related CVD deaths in Beijing is projected to increase by 3.5-10.2% under different RCP scenarios compared with that during the baseline period. Using the same GCM, the future daily maximum temperatures projected using the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios showed a gradually increasing trend. When population change is considered, the annual rate of increase in temperature-related CVD deaths was up to fivefold greater than that under no-population-change scenarios. The decrease in the number of cold-related deaths did not compensate for the increase in that of heat-related deaths, leading to a general increase in the number of temperature-related deaths due to CVD in Beijing. In addition, adaptation to climate change may enhance rather than ameliorate the effect of climate change, as the increase in cold-related CVD mortality greater than the decrease in heat-related CVD mortality in the adaptation scenarios will result in an increase in the total number of temperature-related CVD mortalities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the suitable temperature index to establish temperature-mortality model., METHODS: The mortality and meteorological information of Guangzhou between year 2006 and 2010 were collected to explore the association between sendible temperature, heat index and deaths by adopting distributed lag non-linear model to fit the daily maximum, mean and minimum temperature with and without humidity. Q-Q plots based on the standardized residuals of each model were used to qualitatively access the goodness of fitting. The minimum Akaike information criterion (AIC) and residual sum of squares (RSS) value were used to explore the most suitable temperature index for model establishment, and to further analyze the fittest temperature index for different diseases, ages and cold and hot effect., RESULTS: Guangzhou features a subtropical monsoon climate, with an annual average temperature at 22.9degreeC and daily average relative humidity of 71%. The standardized residuals of all models followed normal distribution. For all death, death from circulation system diseases, the 65-84 years old aging groups and cold effect models, the daily average temperature fit better, whose AIC (RSS) values were the smallest as 11 537 (1897), 9527 (1928), 10 595 (2018) and 11 523 (1899), respectively. However, for death from respiratory system disease, groups aging under 65 years old or over 85 years old and hot effect models, the daily average sendible temperature fit better, whose AIC (RSS) values were the smallest as 8265(1854), 675 (1739), 8550 (1871) and 11 687 (1938), respectively. In comparison with the model controlling both temperature and relative humidity, different diseases, aging groups and cold and hot effect models fitted by sendible temperature index showed smaller AIC (RSS) values. The relative risk (RR) value of the cold effect lagging 0 - 3 days fitting by daily maximal temperature was < 1, and the RR value of it fitting by daily minimum temperature was > 1.04. The RR value of the hot effect lagging 0 - 1 days fitting by daily maximal temperature was < 1.16, and the RR values of it fitting by daily minimum temperature and daily average temperature were > 1.16., CONCLUSION: There were no best temperature indicators for different diseases, ages and cold and hot effect. The model using sendible temperature index better fit the model including relative humidity as a covariable.

AB  - The extreme heat wave in Australia in 2009 resulted in significantly increased number of daily deaths. The circumstances that lead to deaths during extreme heat have not been explored before in Australia. This study aims to identify the individual and community risk factors for deaths during this extreme heat wave in Adelaide. A matched case-control study was conducted. Cases were those who died in the Adelaide metropolitan area during the heat wave period. For each case, two community controls were randomly selected, matched by age and gender. Face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted to collect data of demographic information, living environment, social support, health status and behavioural changes during the heat wave. Descriptive analysis, as well as simple and multiple conditional logistic regressions were performed. In total, 82 deaths and 164 matched community controls were included in the analysis, with a median age of 77.5 (range 26.6-100.7). The multiple logistic regression model indicated that, compared with controls, the risk of death during the heat wave was significantly increased for people living alone (AOR = 42.31, 95 % CI 2.3, 792.8) or having existing chronic heart disease (AOR = 22.4, 95 % CI 1.7, 303.0). In addition, having air conditioning in bedrooms (AOR = 0.004, 95 % CI 0.00006, 0.28) and participating in social activities more than once a week (AOR = 0.011, 95 % CI 0.0004, 0.29) indicated significant protective effects. We have identified factors that could significantly impact on the likelihood of deaths during heat waves. Our findings could assist in the development of future intervention programs and policies to reduce mortality associated with a warmer climate.

Our study aimed to identify risk factors for the excess morbidity., DESIGN: A matched case-control study of risk factors was conducted., SETTING: Patients and matched community controls were interviewed to gather data on demographics, living environment, social support, health status and behaviour changes during the heatwave., PARTICIPANTS: Cases were all hospital admissions with heat-related diagnoses during the 5-day heatwave in 2009. Controls were randomly selected from communities., OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive analyses, simple and multiple conditional logistic regressions were performed. Adjusted ORs (AORs) were estimated., RESULTS: In total, 143 hospital patients and 143 matched community controls were interviewed, with a mean age of 73 years (SD 21), 96% European ethnicity, 63% retired, 36% with high school or higher education, and 8% institutional living. The regression model indicated that compared with the controls, cases were more likely to have heart disease (AOR=13.56, 95% CI 1.27 to 144.86) and dementia (AOR=26.43, 95% CI 1.99 to 350.73). The protective factors included higher education level (AOR=0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.99), having air-conditioner in the bedroom (AOR=0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.74), having an emergency button (AOR=0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.96), using refreshment (AOR=0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.84), and having more social activities (AOR=0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.57)., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing heart disease and dementia significantly increase the risk of direct heat-related hospitalisations during heatwaves. The presence of an air-conditioner in the bedroom, more social activities, a higher education level, use of emergency buttons and refreshments reduce the risk during heatwaves.

TI  - Using a generalized additive model with autoregressive terms to study the effects of daily temperature on mortality
AU  - Yang, Lei; Qin, Guoyou; Zhao, Naiqing; Wang, Chunfang; Song, Guixiang
AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) provides a flexible and effective technique for modelling nonlinear time-series in studies of the health effects of environmental factors. However, GAM assumes that errors are mutually independent, while time series can be correlated in adjacent time points. Here, a GAM with Autoregressive terms (GAMAR) is introduced to fill this gap., METHODS: Parameters in GAMAR are estimated by maximum partial likelihood using modified Newton's method, and the difference between GAM and GAMAR is demonstrated using two simulation studies and a real data example. GAMM is also compared to GAMAR in simulation study 1., RESULTS: In the simulation studies, the bias of the mean estimates from GAM and GAMAR are similar but GAMAR has better coverage and smaller relative error. While the results from GAMM are similar to GAMAR, the estimation procedure of GAMM is much slower than GAMAR. In the case study, the Pearson residuals from the GAM are correlated, while those from GAMAR are quite close to white noise. In addition, the estimates of the temperature effects are different between GAM and GAMAR., CONCLUSIONS: GAMAR incorporates both explanatory variables and AR terms so it can quantify the nonlinear impact of environmental factors on health outcome as well as the serial correlation between the observations. It can be a useful tool in environmental epidemiological studies.

AB  - Extreme heat events have recently become more frequent and represent an increasing risk of damage to public health. However, the existing prediction of heatwave related health effects has limited representativeness and verification. Our study addressed the prediction of heatstroke occurrences based on three years' data of typical cities of hot temperature in China, and examined the importance ranks of model parameters including meteorological and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. The results show that meteorological factors contributed the most to model estimation of the parameters evaluated, and SES parameters, such as the search index, were also important indicators of heatstroke prediction. The model had a satisfying performance compared to traditional linear regression models. The model established in our study can be further applied to extreme weather-related impact research and reduce economic loss due to public health expenses. Copyright 漏 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Internet search trends analysis tools can provide real-time data on kidney stone disease in the United States
AU  - Willard, Scott D.; Nguyen, Mike M.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of using Internet search trends data to estimate kidney stone occurrence and understand the priorities of patients with kidney stones. Internet search trends data represent a unique resource for monitoring population self-reported illness and health information-seeking behavior., METHODS: The Google Insights for Search analysis tool was used to study searches related to kidney stones, with each search term returning a search volume index (SVI) according to the search frequency relative to the total search volume. SVIs for the term, "kidney stones," were compiled by location and time parameters and compared with the published weather and stone prevalence data. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association of the search interest score with known epidemiologic variations in kidney stone disease, including latitude, temperature, season, and state. The frequency of the related search terms was categorized by theme and qualitatively analyzed., RESULTS: The SVI correlated significantly with established kidney stone epidemiologic predictors. The SVI correlated with the state latitude (R-squared=0.25; P<.001), the state mean annual temperature (R-squared=0.24; P<.001), and state combined sex prevalence (R-squared=0.25; P<.001). Female prevalence correlated more strongly than did male prevalence (R-squared=0.37; P<.001, and R-squared=0.17; P=.003, respectively). The national SVI correlated strongly with the average U.S. temperature by month (R-squared=0.54; P=.007). The search term ranking suggested that Internet users are most interested in the diagnosis, followed by etiology, infections, and treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Geographic and temporal variability in kidney stone disease appear to be accurately reflected in Internet search trends data. Internet search trends data might have broader applications for epidemiologic and urologic research. Copyright 漏 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling effects of urban heat island mitigation strategies on heat-related morbidity: a case study for Phoenix, Arizona, USA
AU  - Silva, Humberto R.; Phelan, Patrick E.; Golden, Jay S.
AB  - A zero-dimensional energy balance model was previously developed to serve as a user-friendly mitigation tool for practitioners seeking to study the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Accordingly, this established model is applied here to show the relative effects of four common mitigation strategies: increasing the overall (1) emissivity, (2) percentage of vegetated area, (3) thermal conductivity, and (4) albedo of the urban environment in a series of percentage increases by 5, 10, 15, and 20% from baseline values. In addition to modeling mitigation strategies, we present how the model can be utilized to evaluate human health vulnerability from excessive heat-related events, based on heat-related emergency service data from 2002 to 2006. The 24-h average heat index is shown to have the greatest correlation to heat-related emergency calls in the Phoenix (Arizona, USA) metropolitan region. The four modeled UHI mitigation strategies, taken in combination, would lead to a 48% reduction in annual heat-related emergency service calls, where increasing the albedo is the single most effective UHI mitigation strategy.

AU  - Shabatai, M.; Malamud, A.; Berenheim, J.
AB  - Among life-guards in Israel, there is ten times the incidence of nephrolithiasis (24%) as in the general population. Examination revealed increased mean levels of serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 53.4 +/- 33.6 (S.D.) vs. 21.6 +/- 9.7, and decreased mean levels of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, 421 +/- 234 vs. 566 +/- 175. There was a decreased urinary magnesium/calcium ratio, 72.3 +/- 33.6. Statistically significant hypercalciuria, 308 +/- 45 vs. 168 +/- 63.5, was found in all the life-guards. There was also a significant reduction in daily urinary output among the life-guards in Eilat Bay. It is postulated that overexposure to sunlight and heat initiates as metabolic process in which overproduction of vitamin D, induced by UV radiation, causes increased absorption of calcium from the gut, partial inhibition of parathyroid function, and consequently hypercalciuria. The reduced urinary magnesium/calcium ratio combined with low urinary output may be additional causes for this striking incidence of nephrolithiasis in this particular occupational group. On the basis of these findings, attempts should be made to reduce this high morbidity.

AU  - Sun, Qing Hua; Horton, Radley M.; Bader, Daniel A.; Jones, Bryan; Zhou, Lian; Li, Tian Tian
AB  - The health effects of climatic changes constitute an important research area, yet few researchers have reported city- or region-specific projections of temperature-related deaths based on assumptions about mitigation and adaptation. Herein, we provide quantitative projections for the number of additional deaths expected in the future, owing to the cold and heat in the city of Nanjing, China, based on 31 global circulation models (GCMs), two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and three population scenarios [a constant scenario and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (SSP2 and SSP5)], for the periods of 2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099. The results show that for the period 2070-2099, the net number of temperature-related deaths can be comparable in the cases of RCP4.5/SSP2 and RCP8.5/SSP5 owing to the offsetting effects attributed to the increase of heat related deaths and the decrease of cold-related deaths. In consideration of this adaptation, we suggest that RCP4.5/SSP2 is a better future development pathway/scenario. Copyright 漏 2019 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

AU  - Sun, Q. H.; Wang, W. T.; Wang, Y. W.; Li, T. T.
AB  - Objective: To estimate future excess mortality attributable to cold spells in Guangzhou, China. Methods: We collected the mortality data and metrological data from 2009-2013 of Guangzhou to calculated the association between cold spell days and non-accidental mortality with GLM model. Then we projected future daily average temperatures (2020-2039 (2020s) , 2050-2069 (2050s) , 2080-2099 (2080s) ) with 5 GCMs models and 2 RCPs (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to identify cold spell days. The baseline period was the 1980s (1980-1999). Finally, calculated the yearly cold spells related excess death of 1980s, 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s with average daily death count of non-cold spell days, exposure-response relationship, and yearly number of cold spell days. Results: The average of daily non-accidental mortality in Guangzhou from 2009 to 2013 was 96, and the average of daily average was 22.0 . Cold spell days were associated with 3.3% (95%CI: 0.4%-6.2%) increase in non-accidental mortality. In 1980s, yearly cold spells related deaths were 34 (95%CI: 4-64). In 2020s, the number will increase by 0-10; in 2050s, the number will increase by 1-9; and in 2080s, will increase by 1-9 under the RCP4.5 scenario. In 2020s, the number will increase by 0-9; in 2050s, the number will increase by 1-6; and in 2080s, will increase by 0-11 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Conclusion: The cold spells related non-accidental deaths in Guangzhou will increase in future under climate change.

TI  - Spatio-temporal interaction with disease mapping
AU  - Sun, D.; Tsutakawa, R. K.; Kim, H.; He, Z.
AB  - Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate mortality rates under a Bayesian hierarchical model. Spatial correlations are introduced to examine spatial effects relative to both regional and regional changes over time by groups. A special feature of the models is the inclusion of longitudinal variables which will describe temporal trends in mortality or incidences for different population groups. Disease maps are used to illustrate the role of different parameters in the model and pinpointing areas of interesting patterns. The methods are demonstrated by male cancer mortality data from the state of Missouri during 1973-1992. Of special interest will be the geographic variations in the trend of lung cancer mortality over the recent past. Marginal posterior distributions are used to examine effects due to spatial correlations and age difference in temporal trends. Numerical results from the Missouri data show that although spatial correlations exist, they do not have a large effect on the estimated mortality rates. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The effect of high ambient temperature on the elderly population in three regions of Sweden
AU  - Rocklov, Joacim; Forsberg, Bertil
AB  - The short-term effects of high temperatures are a serious concern in the context of climate change. In areas that today have mild climates the research activity has been rather limited, despite the fact that differences in temperature susceptibility will play a fundamental role in understanding the exposure, acclimatization, adaptation and health risks of a changing climate. In addition, many studies employ biometeorological indexes without careful investigation of the regional heterogeneity in the impact of relative humidity. We aimed to investigate the effects of summer temperature and relative humidity and regional differences in three regions of Sweden allowing for heterogeneity of the effect over the scale of summer temperature. To do so, we collected mortality data for ages 65+ from Stockholm, Goteborg and Skane from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for the years 1998 through 2005. In Stockholm and Skane on average 22 deaths per day occurred, while in Goteborg the mean frequency of daily deaths was 10. We fitted time-series regression models to estimate relative risks of high ambient temperatures on daily mortality using smooth functions to control for confounders, and estimated non-linear effects of exposure while allowing for auto-regressive correlation of observations within summers. The effect of temperature on mortality was found distributed over the same or following day, with statistically significant cumulative combined relative risk of about 5.1% (CI = 0.3, 10.1) per degrees C above the 90th percentile of summer temperature. The effect of high relative humidity was statistically significant in only one of the regions, as was the effect of relative humidity (above 80th percentile) and temperature (above 90th percentile). In the southernmost region studied there appeared to be a significant increase in mortality with decreasing low summer temperatures that was not apparent in the two more northerly situated regions. The effects of warm temperatures on the elderly population in Sweden are rather strong and consistent across different regions after adjustment for mortality displacement. The impact of relative humidity appears to be different in regions, and may be a more important predictor of mortality in some areas.

TI  - A new approach for combining information available from multiple particulate air pollution monitors
AU  - Roberts, Steven; Martin, Michael
AB  - In time-series studies on the effect of particulate matter (PM) air pollution on an adverse health outcome, PM time-series data are often available from multiple monitoring stations. Published studies have combined the data from the multiple monitors using a simple or trimmed average. We investigate an alternative method of combining the data available from multiple PM-monitoring sites. This method uses time-series data to assign each PM monitor a weight. The weights are then used to combine the data from the multiple PM monitors into a single air pollution time series. The resulting model will identify important monitors for describing the relationship between PM and the adverse health outcome of interest. Subsequent investigations of why certain monitors are more informative than others may provide valuable information concerning the location of vulnerable subpopulations or locations where the meteorological and/or land-use conditions are better for assessing population exposure to PM. The new model is illustrated by applying it to actual data from Cook County, IL, USA and through a simulation study. Using the new model, for the Cook County data, it was found that two of the six monitors provided essentially as much information about the effect of PM on mortality as all six monitors combined. The simulation study suggests that the weights assigned to each monitor by the new model are appropriate, that is, that the model assigns the largest weight to the monitor most highly correlated with the underlying PM time series used to generate mortality.

AU  - Perico, Norberto; Remuzzi, Giuseppe
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important determinant of the poor health outcome for major noncommunicable diseases that are the leading cause of death worldwide. Early recognition with screening programs of CKD and co-morbid conditions, like hypertension, diabetes, or toxic environments, can potentially slow progression to renal failure, improve quality of life and reduce healthcare cost. Effective multimodal tools are available to prevent CKD by managing its risk factors, and to slow or even halt disease progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF). They can be adapted even to poor-resource settings of low- and middle-income countries for individual at high risk of CKD. CKD is also linked to acute kidney injury (AKI), that in poorest part of Africa, Asia and Latin America is preventable, treatable and often reversible, if managed adequately and in timely manner as proposed by the program "AKI 0by25" launched by the international Society of Nephrology in 2013. In addition to saving lives, prevention programs will create major heath gains, eventually reducing the current health inequity that arises from unaffordable or unobtainable renal replacement therapies in many part of the developing world if ESRF is not prevented.

AU  - Ramgopal, Sriram; Dunnick, Jennifer; Owusu-Ansah, Sylvia; Siripong, Nalyn; Salcido, David D.; Martin-Gill, Christian
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluctuations in emergency medical services (EMS) responses can have a substantial impact on the ability of agencies to meet resource needs within an EMS system. We aimed to identify weather characteristics as potentially predictable factors associated with EMS responses., METHODS: We reviewed hourly counts of scene responses documented by 24 EMS agencies in Western Pennsylvania from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017 and compared rates of responses to weather characteristics. Responses to counties nonadjacent to the studied weather reporting station and interfacility/scheduled transports were excluded. We identified the mean temperature, meters visibility, dew point, wind speed, total millimeters of precipitation, and presence of rain or snow in 6-hour windows prior to dispatch, in addition to temporal factors of time of day and weekend vs. weekday. Analysis was performed using multivariable linear regression of a negative binomial distribution, reporting incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Secondary analyses were performed for transports to the hospital and cases involving transports for traumatic complaints and pediatric patients (age <18 years)., RESULTS: We included 529,058 responses (54.8% female, mean age 57.2 +/- SD 24.7 years). In our multivariable model, responses were associated with (IRR, 95% CI) rain (1.10, 1.08-1.11) snow (1.07, 1.05-1.09), and both rain and snow (1.15, 1.11-1.19). A lower incidence of responses occurred on weekends (0.84, 0.83-0.85) and at night (0.62, 0.61-0.62). Increasing temperature in 5 degreeC increments was associated with an increase in responses across seasons with an effect that varied between 1.16 (1.15-1.17) in winter to 1.31 (1.28-1.33) in summer. Windy weather was associated with increased responses from light breeze (1.10, 1.09-1.11) to fresh breeze or greater (1.23, 1.16-1.30). Transports occurred in a similar pattern to responses. Trauma transports (n = 64,235) occurred more during weekends (1.04, 1.02-1.06). Pediatric transports (n = 21,880) were not significantly associated with precipitation or season., CONCLUSION: EMS responses increased with rising temperature and following rain and snow. These findings may assist in planning by EMS agencies and emergency departments to identify periods of greatest resource utilization.

TI  - Impact of regional climate change on human health
AU  - Patz, Jonathan A.; Campbell-Lendrum, Diarmid; Holloway, Tracey; Foley, Jonathan A.
AB  - The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing evidence that climate-health relationships pose increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans that are currently subjected to large rainfall variability due to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation sub-Saharan Africa and sprawling cities where the urban heat island effect could intensify extreme climatic events.

TI  - Lissajous figures: An engineering tool for root cause analysis of individual cases-A preliminary concept
AU  - Palmer, K.; Ridgway, T.; Al-Rawi, O.; Johnson, I.; Poullis, M.
AB  - Some patients have short intensive care stay periods and little or no organ dysfunction after cardiac surgery and others do not despite seemingly faultless surgery, perfusion, and anesthesia. These "unknown" reasons for death and morbidity usually relate to organ ischemia and inflammation, but are obviously mutlifactorial. A Lissajous figure is a technique in electrical engineering to compare two different electrical signals. We utilize this basic concept in a very simple manner to potentially identify why some of these unknown deaths or morbidities occur. Utilizing an electronic perfusion database, we retrospectively analyzed 43 patients undergoing aortic surgery with regard to central venous saturations during cooling and rewarming. Isolated aortic valve replacement patients were excluded. Central venous saturation, time, and temperature were plotted to create a Lissajous figure for the whole operation, and during cooling and rewarming separately. Temperature and saturations were analyzed every 20 seconds. Perfusion related variables were registered and uploaded to www.perfsort.net. Lissajous figures during cooling add little to patient care due to their similarity. Isolated rewarming revealed startling differences. It is immediately visually obvious who had short and long periods of tissue ischemia and reperfusion during rewarming in a seemingly uneventful operation. The periods of ischemia can be semi quantified into: none, mild, moderate, and severe. Creation of simple Lissajous figures during rewarming for bypass runs may be an additional helpful tool in root cause analysis of patient death/morbidity when surgery, perfusion, and anesthesia seemed faultless. Low central venous saturations at hypothermic temperatures mean significant metabolic activity, indicating tissue ischemia is occurring. Further work is needed to correlate this concept to outcomes.

TI  - Disparities by race in heat-related mortality in four US cities: the role of air conditioning prevalence
AU  - O'Neill, Marie S.; Zanobetti, Antonella; Schwartz, Joel
AB  - Daily mortality is typically higher on hot days in urban areas, and certain population groups experience disproportionate risk. Air conditioning (AC) has been recommended to mitigate heat-related illness and death. We examined whether AC prevalence explained differing heat-related mortality effects by race. Poisson regression was used to model daily mortality in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh. Predictors included natural splines of time (to control seasonal patterns); mean daily apparent temperature on the day of death, and averaged over lags 1-3; barometric pressure; day of week; and a linear term for airborne particles. Separate, city-specific models were fit to death counts stratified by race (Black or White) to derive the percent change in mortality at 29 degrees C, relative to 15 degrees C (lag 0). Next, city-specific effects were regressed on city- and race-specific AC prevalence. Combined effect estimates across all cities were calculated using inverse variance-weighted averages. Prevalence of central AC among Black households was less than half that among White households in all four cities, and deaths among Blacks were more strongly associated with hot temperatures. Central AC prevalence explained some of the differences in heat effects by race, but room-unit AC did not. Efforts to reduce disparities in heat-related mortality should consider access to AC.

AU  - Morabito, Marco; Crisci, Alfonso; Messeri, Alessandro; Capecchi, Valerio; Modesti, Pietro Amedeo; Gensini, Gian Franco; Orlandini, Simone
AB  - The aim of this study is to identify the most effective thermal predictor of heat-related very-elderly mortality in two cities located in different geographical contexts of central Italy. We tested the hypothesis that use of the state-of-the-art rational thermal indices, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), might provide an improvement in predicting heat-related mortality with respect to other predictors. Data regarding very elderly people (>= 75 years) who died in inland and coastal cities from 2006 to 2008 (May-October) and meteorological and air pollution were obtained from the regional mortality and environmental archives. Rational (UTCI) and direct thermal indices represented by a set of bivariate/multivariate apparent temperature indices were assessed. Correlation analyses and generalized additive models were applied. The Akaike weights were used for the best model selection. Direct multivariate indices showed the highest correlations with UTCI and were also selected as the best thermal predictors of heat-related mortality for both inland and coastal cities. Conversely, the UTCI was never identified as the best thermal predictor. The use of direct multivariate indices, which also account for the extra effect of wind speed and/or solar radiation, revealed the best fitting with all-cause, very-elderly mortality attributable to heat stress.

TI  - Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury With a Machine Learning Algorithm Using Electronic Health Record Data
AU  - Mohamadlou, H.; Lynn-Palevsky, A.; Barton, C.; Chettipally, U.; Shieh, L.; Calvert, J.; Saber, N. R.; Das, R.
AB  - Background: A major problem in treating acute kidney injury (AKI) is that clinical criteria for recognition are markers of established kidney damage or impaired function; treatment before such damage manifests is desirable. Clinicians could intervene during what may be a crucial stage for preventing permanent kidney injury if patients with incipient AKI and those at high risk of developing AKI could be identified. Objective(s): In this study, we evaluate a machine learning algorithm for early detection and prediction of AKI. Design(s): We used a machine learning technique, boosted ensembles of decision trees, to train an AKI prediction tool on retrospective data taken from more than 300 000 inpatient encounters. Setting(s): Data were collected from inpatient wards at Stanford Medical Center and intensive care unit patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Patient(s): Patients older than the age of 18 whose hospital stays lasted between 5 and 1000 hours and who had at least one documented measurement of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, serum creatinine (SCr), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Measurements: We tested the algorithm's ability to detect AKI at onset and to predict AKI 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours before onset. Method(s): We tested AKI detection and prediction using the National Health Service (NHS) England AKI Algorithm as a gold standard. We additionally tested the algorithm's ability to detect AKI as defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. We compared the algorithm's 3-fold cross-validation performance to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for AKI identification in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). Result(s): The algorithm demonstrated high AUROC for detecting and predicting NHS-defined AKI at all tested time points. The algorithm achieves AUROC of 0.872 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.867-0.878) for AKI detection at time of onset. For prediction 12 hours before onset, the algorithm achieves an AUROC of 0.800 (95% CI, 0.792-0.809). For 24-hour predictions, the algorithm achieves AUROC of 0.795 (95% CI, 0.785-0.804). For 48-hour and 72-hour predictions, the algorithm achieves AUROC values of 0.761 (95% CI, 0.753-0.768) and 0.728 (95% CI, 0.719-0.737), respectively. Limitation(s): Because of the retrospective nature of this study, we cannot draw any conclusions about the impact the algorithm's predictions will have on patient outcomes in a clinical setting. Conclusion(s): The results of these experiments suggest that a machine learning-based AKI prediction tool may offer important prognostic capabilities for determining which patients are likely to suffer AKI, potentially allowing clinicians to intervene before kidney damage manifests.Copyright 漏 The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Development of a heat vulnerability index for New York State
AU  - Nayak, S. G.; Shrestha, S.; Kinney, P. L.; Ross, Z.; Sheridan, S. C.; Pantea, C. I.; Hsu, W. H.; Muscatiello, N.; Hwang, S. A.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The frequency and intensity of extreme heat events are increasing in New York State (NYS) and have been linked with increased heat-related morbidity and mortality. But these effects are not uniform across the state and can vary across large regions due to regional sociodemographic and environmental factors which impact an individual's response or adaptive capacity to heat and in turn contribute to vulnerability among certain populations. We developed a heat vulnerability index (HVI) to identify heat-vulnerable populations and regions in NYS., STUDY DESIGN: Census tract level environmental and sociodemographic heat-vulnerability variables were used to develop the HVI to identify heat-vulnerable populations and areas., METHODS: Variables were identified from a comprehensive literature review and climate-health research in NYS. We obtained data from 2010 US Census Bureau and 2011 National Land Cover Database. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated variables to fewer uncorrelated components, and then calculated the cumulative HVI for each census tract by summing up the scores across the components. The HVI was then mapped across NYS (excluding New York City) to display spatial vulnerability. The prevalence rates of heat stress were compared across HVI score categories., RESULTS: Thirteen variables were reduced to four meaningful components representing 1) social/language vulnerability; 2) socioeconomic vulnerability; 3) environmental/urban vulnerability; and 4) elderly/ social isolation. Vulnerability to heat varied spatially in NYS with the HVI showing that metropolitan areas were most vulnerable, with language barriers and socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to the most vulnerability. Reliability of the HVI was supported by preliminary results where higher rates of heat stress were collocated in the regions with the highest HVI., CONCLUSIONS: The NYS HVI showed spatial variability in heat vulnerability across the state. Mapping the HVI allows quick identification of regions in NYS that could benefit from targeted interventions. The HVI will be used as a planning tool to help allocate appropriate adaptation measures like cooling centers and issue heat alerts to mitigate effects of heat in vulnerable areas.

TI  - Research methods for assessing the health impacts of climate change
AU  - Menne, B.; Laschewski, G.; Kovats, R. S.; Jendritzky, G.
AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO) some of the effects of climate change on human health will result mainly from disturbances to complex physical and ecological processes (e.g. indirect effects by changes in patterns of infectious disease, drinking-water supplies and agricultural yields). Others will result from direct effects (e.g. heatwave-related deaths and skin cancer induced by ultraviolet radiation). This article addresses the research methods, currently in use, applicable to projecting and assessing the potential health impacts of climate change. The complexity of the problem requires integrative modelling which is a qualitatively new approach in medical/public health studies. The role of the traditional analogous studies as an independant method will be transformed to that one which makes the input information available for the modelling process. There has been little formal research into the health impacts of climate change. Much of the research cannot be done within a simple empirical framework. The research requires an unusual reliance on an interdisciplinary approach. There is now an urgent need to focus research capacities and efforts more sharply. This need has also been recognized in the recommendations being proposed, to the Third Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health (London, June 1999) by the European Science Foundation, the European Commission and WHO. In the German climate research program DEKLIM the German Ministery of Education and Research also sets priorities to inter-/multidisciplinary approaches between the natural and social sciences.

AU  - Miron, Isidro J.; Criado-Alvarez, Juan Jose; Diaz, Julio; Linares, Cristina; Mayoral, Sheila; Montero, Juan Carlos
AB  - The relationship between air temperature and human mortality is described as non-linear, with mortality tending to rise in response to increasingly hot or cold ambient temperatures from a given minimum mortality or optimal comfort temperature, which varies from some areas to others according to their climatic and socio-demographic characteristics. Changes in these characteristics within any specific region could modify this relationship. This study sought to examine the time trend in the maximum temperature of minimum organic-cause mortality in Castile-La Mancha, from 1975 to 2003. The analysis was performed by using daily series of maximum temperatures and organic-cause mortality rates grouped into three decades (1975-1984, 1985-1994, 1995-2003) to compare confidence intervals (p<0.05) obtained by estimating the 10-yearly mortality rates corresponding to the maximum temperatures of minimum mortality calculated for each decade. Temporal variations in the effects of cold and heat on mortality were ascertained by means of ARIMA models (Box-Jenkins) and cross-correlation functions (CCF) at seven lags. We observed a significant decrease in comfort temperature (from 34.2 degrees C to 27.8 degrees C) between the first two decades in the Province of Toledo, along with a growing number of significant lags in the summer CFF (1, 3 and 5, respectively). The fall in comfort temperature is attributable to the increase in the effects of heat on mortality, due, in all likelihood, to the percentage increase in the elderly population.

AU  - Luther, M.; Gardiner, F. W.; Hansen, C.; Caldicott, D.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether a revised heat warning threshold provides an enhanced predictive tool for increases in Emergency Department heat-related presentations in Canberra, Australia. All Emergency Department triage records containing the word "heat", as well as those diagnosing a heat related illness for the summer periods 2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016 were searched. Then a medical record review was conducted to confirm that the patient's presentation was related to environmental heat, which was defined by the final clinical diagnosis, presentation complaint and details of the patient's treatment. Researchers then compared this presentation data, to a mean threshold formula. The mean threshold formula included the past three consecutive daily mean temperatures and the last measured temperature upon presentation. This formula was designed to take into account the variance of night-time lows, with concurrent daily ambient temperatures, and was used to determine whether there was a correlation between heat-related presentations and increasing mean temperatures. Heat-related presentations appeared to occur when the mean threshold temperature reached 25degreeC (77degreeF), with significant increases when the mean threshold reached 30degreeC (86degreeF). These results confirm that a mean temperature of 30degreeC corresponds to a relevant local public health heat-related threat.Copyright 漏 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct health effects of extreme temperatures are a significant environmental health problem in Lithuania, and could worsen further under climate change. This paper attempts to describe the change in environmental temperature conditions that the urban population of Vilnius could experience under climate change, and the effects such change could have on excess heat-related and cold-related mortality in two future periods within the 21st century., METHODS: We modelled the urban climate of Vilnius for the summer and winter seasons during a sample period (2009-2015) and projected summertime and wintertime daily temperatures for two prospective periods, one in the near (2030-2045) and one in the far future (2085-2100), under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. We then analysed the historical relationship between temperature and mortality for the period 2009-2015, and estimated the projected mortality in the near future and far future periods under a changing climate and population, assuming alternatively no acclimatisation and acclimatisation to heat and cold based on a constant-percentile threshold temperature., RESULTS: During the sample period 2009-2015 in summertime we observed an increase in daily mortality from a maximum daily temperature of 30degreeC (the 96th percentile of the series), with an average of around 7 deaths per year. Under a no acclimatisation scenario, annual average heat-related mortality would rise to 24 deaths/year (95% CI: 8.4-38.4) in the near future and to 46 deaths/year (95% CI: 16.4-74.4) in the far future. Under a heat acclimatisation scenario, mortality would not increase significantly in the near or in the far future. Regarding wintertime cold-related mortality in the sample period 2009-2015, we observed increased mortality on days on which the minimum daily temperature fell below -12degreeC (the 7th percentile of the series), with an average of around 10 deaths a year. Keeping the threshold temperature constant, annual average cold-related mortality would decrease markedly in the near future, to 5 deaths/year (95% CI: 0.8-7.9) and even more in the far future, down to 0.44 deaths/year (95% C: 0.1-0.8). Assuming a "middle ground" between the acclimatisation and non-acclimatisation scenarios, the decrease in cold-related mortality will not compensate the increase in heat-related mortality., CONCLUSION: Thermal extremes, both heat and cold, constitute a serious public health threat in Vilnius, and in a changing climate the decrease in mortality attributable to cold will not compensate for the increase in mortality attributable to heat. Study results reinforce the notion that public health prevention against thermal extremes should be designed as a dynamic, adaptive process from the inception. Copyright 漏 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Martinez, Gerardo Sanchez; Baccini, Michela; De Ridder, Koen; Hooyberghs, Hans; Lefebvre, Wouter; Kendrovski, Vladimir; Scott, Kristen; Spasenovska, Margarita
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive summer heat is a serious environmental health problem in Skopje, the capital and largest city of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This paper attempts to forecast the impact of heat on mortality in Skopje in two future periods under climate change and compare it with a historical baseline period., METHODS: After ascertaining the relationship between daily mean ambient air temperature and daily mortality in Skopje, we modelled the evolution of ambient temperatures in the city under a Representative Concentration Pathway scenario (RCP8.5) and the evolution of the city population in two future time periods: 2026-2045 and 2081-2100, and in a past time period (1986-2005) to serve as baseline for comparison. We then calculated the projected average annual mortality attributable to heat in the absence of adaptation or acclimatization during those time windows, and evaluated the contribution of each source of uncertainty on the final impact., RESULTS: Our estimates suggest that, compared to the baseline period (1986-2005), heat-related mortality in Skopje would more than double in 2026-2045, and more than quadruple in 2081-2100. When considering the impact in 2081-2100, sampling variability around the heat-mortality relationship and climate model explained 40.3 and 46.6 % of total variability., CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of a long-term perspective in the public health prevention of heat exposure, particularly in the context of a changing climate.

TI  - Conceptual and methodological challenges in predicting the health impacts of climate change
AU  - McMichael, A. J.
AB  - Describing (not to mention quantifying) the anticipated adverse health impacts of global climate change poses basic challenges to biomedical science. First and foremost, it is beset with uncertainties and complexities; it is necessarily an 'If-Then' exercise, that takes as given climatologists' estimates of the plausible range of greenhouse-induced climate change over the coming century. The health impacts of climate change would generally not occur via the familiar direct-acting mechanisms that characterise local environmentally-induced toxicology or pathophysiology; therefore they would lack the mechanistic directness-of-effect that epidemiological research methods are best equipped to study. Rather, the health impacts would occur on a larger scale, and would result predominantly from perturbations of natural biogeochemical systems that reduce Earth's capacity for life support. Therefore, scientists will need to address the assessment of impacts within an ecological framework, and with an unusually long time horizon. This assessment requires a new capacity for systems-based thinking, predictive modelling, and dealing with uncertainty. Scientists, policy-makers and general public will have to adjust to unfamiliar styles of 'anticipatory' science, with an unusual overlay of uncertainty and provisionality.

TI  - Future temperature-related years of life lost projections for cardiovascular disease in Tianjin, China
AU  - Li, Guoxing; Li, Yixue; Tian, Lin; Guo, Qun; Pan, Xiaochuan
AB  - It is widely accepted that temperatures is associated with cardiovascular mortality, however, few studies have explored the effects of temperature on years of life lost (YLL) from cardiovascular mortality in China under future global warming scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to obtain projections of YLL from cardiovascular diseases. Here we applied nineteen global-scale climate models (GCMs) and three Representative Concentration Pathway emission scenarios (RCPs) in the 2050s and 2070s for temperature-related YLL projection in Tianjin, China. We found the relationships between daily maximum temperatures with YLL from cardiovascular mortality were basically U-shaped. We observed increasing net annual YLL across a range of multiple models under different climate scenarios, suggesting that increasing heat-related YLL from cardiovascular mortality could offset decreasing cold-related YLL from cardiovascular mortality. The largest temperature-related YLL from cardiovascular mortality were observed under the RCP8.5 scenario and increased more rapidly in the 2070s versus the 2050s. Monthly analyses of percent changes in YLL from cardiovascular mortality showed that the largest percent increases occurred from May to September. If warm adaptation occurs, only the adverse effects under RCP2.6 could be fully offset in both 2050 and 2070. Our exploration provided further evidence for the potential health impacts of global warming and highlighted that government should develop environmental policies for future health risks.

TI  - Temperature-Related Summer Mortality Under Multiple Climate, Population, and Adaptation Scenarios
AU  - Lee, Jae Young; Lee, Woo-Seop; Ebi, Kristie L.; Kim, Ho
AB  - Projections of the magnitude and pattern of possible health risks from climate change should be based on multiple climate and development scenarios to describe the range of uncertainties, to inform effective and efficient policies. For a better understanding of climate change-related risks in seven metropolitan cities of South Korea, we estimated temperature-related summer (June to August) mortality until 2100 using projected changes in climate, population, and adaptation. In addition, we extracted the variations in the mortality estimates associated with uncertainties in climate, population, and adaptation scenarios using 25 climate models, two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), three population scenarios (high, medium and low variants), and four adaptation scenarios (absolute threshold shift, slope reduction in the temperature-mortality relationship, a combination of slope reduction and threshold shift, and a sigmoid function based on the historical trend). Compared to the baseline period (1991-2015), temperature-attributable mortality in South Korea during summer in the 2090s is projected to increase 5.1 times for RCP 4.5 and 12.9 times for RCP 8.5 due to climate and population changes. Estimated future mortality varies by up to +44%/-55%, -80%, -60%, and +12%/-11% associated with the choice of climate models, adaptation, climate, and population scenarios, respectively, compared to the mortality estimated for the median of the climate models, no adaptation, RCP 8.5, and medium population variant. Health system choices about adaptation are the most important determinants of future mortality after climate projections. The range of possible future mortality underscores the importance of flexible, iterative risk management.

TI  - The impact of global warming on health and mortality
AU  - Keatinge, W. R.; Donaldson, G. C.
AB  - Initial concern about the possible effects of global warming on infections has declined with the realization that the spread of tropical diseases is likely to be limited and controllable. However, the direct effects of heat already cause substantial numbers of deaths among vulnerable people in the summer. Action to prevent these deaths from rising is the most obvious medical challenge presented by a global rise in temperature. Strategies to prevent such deaths are in place to some extent, and they differ between the United States and Europe. Air conditioning has reduced them in the United States, and older technologies such as fans, shade, and buildings designed to keep cool on hot days have generally done so in Europe. Since the energy requirements of air conditioning accelerate global warming, a combination of the older methods, backed up by use of air conditioning when necessary, can provide the ideal solution. Despite the availability of these technologies, occasional record high temperatures still cause sharp rises in heat-related deaths as the climate warms. The most important single piece of advice at the time a heat wave strikes is that people having dangerous heat stress need immediate cooling, eg, by a cool bath. Such action at home can be more effective than transporting the patient to hospital. Meanwhile, it must not be forgotten that cold weather in winter causes-many more deaths than heat in summer, even in most subtropical regions, and measures to control cold-related deaths need to continue.

TI  - Ambient air pollution, climate change, and population health in China
AU  - Kan, Haidong; Chen, Renjie; Tong, Shilu
AB  - As the largest developing country, China has been changing rapidly over the last three decades and its economic expansion is largely driven by the use of fossil fuels, which leads to a dramatic increase in emissions of both ambient air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs). China is now facing the worst air pollution problem in the world, and is also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. A number of epidemiological studies on air pollution and population health have been conducted in China, using time-series, case-crossover, cross-sectional, cohort, panel or intervention designs. The increased health risks observed among Chinese population are somewhat lower in magnitude, per amount of pollution, than the risks found in developed countries. However, the importance of these increased health risks is greater than that in North America or Europe, because the levels of air pollution in China are very high in general and Chinese population accounts for more than one fourth of the world's totals. Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that climate change has already affected human health directly and indirectly in China, including mortality from extreme weather events; changes in air and water quality; and changes in the ecology of infectious diseases. If China acts to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant air pollution, it will reap not only the health benefits associated with improvement of air quality but also the reduced GHG emissions.

TI  - A data-driven approach to setting trigger temperatures for heat health emergencies
AU  - Henderson, Sarah B.; Kosatsky, Tom
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unprecedentedly hot weather during the summer of 2009 resulted in considerable excess mortality in Greater Vancouver, Canada. Local municipalities and public health authorities requested a rapid, evidence-based recommendation for the temperature above which emergency action plans should be triggered to reduce potentially-avoidable mortality during future events., METHODS: Candidate trigger temperatures were identified by examining the coincidence of extreme mortality days with extreme temperature days, using temperatures observed at two regional airports. Days when the two coincided between 2005 and 2009 were defined as historical heat health emergencies. Forecast and observed temperatures were combined in multiple early warning scenarios to retrospectively test the capacity to predict those heat health emergency dates, and results were expressed in terms of true positive (emergency predicted when one occurred) and false positive (emergency predicted when one did not occur) triggers., RESULTS: Extreme mortality was observed when the 2-day average of maximum temperatures was > or =31 degrees C at the coastal airport and > or =36 degrees C at the inland airport. When observed and forecast temperatures were combined in different early warning scenarios, all historical heat health emergencies were correctly identified in four of twelve cases, with a minimum of two false positive triggers., CONCLUSIONS: A heat health emergency should be triggered for Greater Vancouver when the average of the current day's 14:00 observed temperature and the next day's forecast high is > or =29 degrees C on the coast and/or > or =34 degrees C inland. This condition provided 19 hours of lead time for preparation and was clearly understood by emergency responders and other users.

TI  - What do epidemiological studies tell us about chronic kidney disease of undetermined cause in Meso-America? A systematic review and meta-analysis
AU  - Gonzalez-Quiroz, Marvin; Pearce, Neil; Caplin, Ben; Nitsch, Dorothea
AB  - Background: The aim of this systematic review is to examine the epidemiological knowledge and gaps in understanding of the potential causes of chronic kidney disease of undetermined cause (CKDu) in Meso-America., Methods: A systematic literature search of epidemiological studies of CKDu was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from January 2000 to January 2017. Study quality was assessed by adapting the tool from Higgins et al. for observational studies. Where applicable, the summary prevalence odds ratio (POR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random effects model., Results: Twenty-five epidemiological studies were included in the analysis of risk factors for CKDu. The quality assessment of each occupational and community study was medium. The PORs for CKDu were males versus females 2.42 (95% CI 1.76-3.08), family history of CKD (versus none) 1.84 (95% CI 1.37-2.30), high water intake (versus low) 1.61 (95% CI 1.01-2.21) and low altitude (versus highland) 2.09 (95% CI 1.00-3.17). There were no significant associations between CKDu and pesticide exposure (versus no) 1.17 (95% CI 0.87-1.46), alcohol consumption (versus no) 1.34 (95% CI 0.84-1.84), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (versus no) 0.99 (95% CI 0.60-1.39) and heat stress (versus no) 1.52 (95% CI -0.91 - 3.95)., Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed positive associations for males (versus females) and family history of CKD, water intake, lowland altitude and CKDu. There were no significant associations with pesticide exposure, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intake, heat stress and alcohol consumption.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We previously developed a model for projection of heat-related mortality attributable to climate change. The objective of this paper is to improve the fit and precision of and examine the robustness of the model., METHODS: We obtained daily data for number of deaths and maximum temperature from respective governmental organizations of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the USA, and European countries. For future projection, we used the Bergen climate model 2 (BCM2) general circulation model, the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B socioeconomic scenario, and the mortality projection for the 65+-year-old age group developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The heat-related excess mortality was defined as follows: The temperature-mortality relation forms a V-shaped curve, and the temperature at which mortality becomes lowest is called the optimum temperature (OT). The difference in mortality between the OT and a temperature beyond the OT is the excess mortality. To develop the model for projection, we used Japanese 47-prefecture data from 1972 to 2008. Using a distributed lag nonlinear model (two-dimensional nonparametric regression of temperature and its lag effect), we included the lag effect of temperature up to 15 days, and created a risk function curve on which the projection is based. As an example, we perform a future projection using the above-mentioned risk function. In the projection, we used 1961-1990 temperature as the baseline, and temperatures in the 2030s and 2050s were projected using the BCM2 global circulation model, SRES A1B scenario, and WHO-provided annual mortality. Here, we used the "counterfactual method" to evaluate the climate change impact; For example, baseline temperature and 2030 mortality were used to determine the baseline excess, and compared with the 2030 excess, for which we used 2030 temperature and 2030 mortality. In terms of adaptation to warmer climate, we assumed 0 % adaptation when the OT as of the current climate is used and 100 % adaptation when the OT as of the future climate is used. The midpoint of the OTs of the two types of adaptation was set to be the OT for 50 % adaptation., RESULTS: We calculated heat-related excess mortality for 2030 and 2050., CONCLUSIONS: Our new model is considered to be better fit, and more precise and robust compared with the previous model.

TI  - Heat exposure during outdoor activities in the US varies significantly by city, demography, and activity
AU  - Hoehne, Christopher G.; Hondula, David M.; Chester, Mikhail V.; Eisenman, David P.; Middel, Ariane; Fraser, Andrew M.; Watkins, Lance; Gerster, Katrina
AB  - Environmental heat is a growing public health concern in cities. Urbanization and global climate change threaten to exacerbate heat as an already significant environmental cause of human morbidity and mortality. Despite increasing risk, very little is known regarding determinants of outdoor urban heat exposure. To provide additional evidence for building community and national-scale resilience to extreme heat, we assess how US outdoor urban heat exposure varies by city, demography, and activity. We estimate outdoor urban heat exposure by pairing individual-level data from the American Time Use Survey (2004-2015) with corresponding meteorological data for 50 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the US. We also assess the intersection of activity intensity and heat exposure by pairing metabolic intensities with individual-level time-use data. We model an empirical relationship between demographic indicators and daily heat exposure with controls for spatiotemporal factors. We find higher outdoor heat exposure among the elderly and low-income individuals, and lower outdoor heat exposure in females, young adults, and those identifying as Black race. Traveling, lawn and garden care, and recreation are the most common outdoor activities to contribute to heat exposure. We also find individuals in cities with the most extreme temperatures do not necessarily have the highest outdoor heat exposure. The findings reveal large contrasts in outdoor heat exposure between different cities, demographic groups, and activities. Resolving the interplay between exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and behavior as determinants of heat-health risk will require advances in observational and modeling tools, especially at the individual scale.

TI  - Climate gerontology: meeting the challenge of population ageing and climate change
AU  - Haq, G.; Gutman, G.
AB  - The global population is ageing at a time when climate variability is increasing. It is argued that if we are to minimize the negative impact of environmental change on older people, interdisciplinary study of the convergence of the two trends, "climate gerontology", is needed. Climate gerontology can examine the unique challenges and needs of older people in coping with extreme weather events. It can contribute to our understanding of the everyday challenges of growing old in a changing climate and how we can achieve the "longevity dividend". In particular, it can lead the way to the development of effective policies to reduce the carbon footprint of people during their life course, protect older people from climate-related threats and mobilize their wealth of knowledge and experience to address these.

TI  - The Excess Winter Deaths Measure: Why Its Use Is Misleading for Public Health Understanding of Cold-related Health Impacts
AU  - Hajat, Shakoor; Gasparrini, Antonio
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excess winter deaths, the ratio between average daily deaths in December-March versus other months, is a measure commonly used by public health practitioners and analysts to assess health burdens associated with wintertime weather. We seek to demonstrate that this measure is fundamentally biased and can lead to misleading conclusions about health impacts associated with current and future winter climate., METHODS: Time series regression analysis of 779,372 deaths from natural causes in London over 15 years (1 August 1997-31 July 2012),collapsed by day of death and linked to daily temperature values. The outcome measures were the excess winter deaths index, and daily and annual deaths attributable specifically to cold., RESULTS: Most of the excess winter deaths are driven by cold: The excess winter deaths index decreased from 1.19 to 1.07 after excluding deaths attributable to low temperatures. Over 40% of cold-attributable deaths occurred outside of the December-March period, leading to bias in the excess winter deaths measure. Although there was no relationship between winter severity and annual excess winter deaths, there was a clear correlation with annual cold-attributable deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Excess winter deaths is not an appropriate indicator of cold-related health impacts, and its use should be discontinued. We advocate alternative measures. The findings we present bring into doubt previous claims that cold-related deaths in the UK will not reduce in future as a result of climate change.

TI  - Impact of high temperatures on mortality: is there an added heat wave effect?
AU  - Hajat, Shakoor; Armstrong, Ben; Baccini, Michela; Biggeri, Annibale; Bisanti, Luigi; Russo, Antonio; Paldy, Anna; Menne, Bettina; Kosatsky, Tom
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality during sustained periods of hot weather is generally regarded as being in excess of what would be predicted from smooth temperature-mortality gradients estimated using standard time-series regression models. However, the evidence for an effect of continuous days of exceptional heat ("heat wave effect") is indirect. In addition, because some interventions may be triggered only during forecasted heat waves, it would be helpful to know what fraction of all heat-related deaths falls during these specific periods and what fraction occurs throughout the remainder of the summer., METHODS: Extended time-series data sets of daily mortality counts in 3 major European cities (London, 28 years of data; Budapest, 31 years; Milan, 18 years) were examined in relation to hot weather using a generalized estimating equations approach. We modeled temperature and specific heat wave terms using a variety of specifications., RESULTS: With a linear effect of same-day temperature above an identified threshold, an additional "heat wave" effect of 5.5% was observed in London (95% confidence interval = 2.2 to 8.9), 9.3% in Budapest (5.8 to 13.0), and 15.2% in Milan (5.7 to 22.5). Heat wave effects were reduced slightly when we relaxed the linear assumption and these effects were reduced substantially when temperature was modeled as an average value of lags 0 to 2 days. In London, fewer than half of all heat-related deaths could be attributed to identified heat wave periods. In Milan and Budapest, the fraction was less than one fifth., CONCLUSIONS: Heat wave effects were apparent in simple time-series models but were reduced in multilag nonlinear models and small when compared with the overall summertime mortality burden of heat. Reduction of the overall heat burden requires preventive measures in addition to those that target warnings and responses uniquely to heat waves.

TI  - Hypothesis: Urbanization and exposure to urban heat islands contribute to increasing prevalence of kidney stones
AU  - Goldfarb, David S.; Hirsch, Jacqueline
AB  - The prevalence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. Various etiologies may in part explain this observation including increased prevalence of diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, increased dietary protein and salt content, and decreased dietary dairy products. We hypothesize an additional and novel potential contributor to increasing kidney stone prevalence: migration to urban settings, or urbanization, and resultant exposure of the population to the higher temperatures of urban heat islands (UHIs). Both urbanization and exposure to UHIs are worldwide, continuous trends. Because the difference in temperature between rural and urban settings is greater than the increase in temperature caused by global warming, the potential effect of urbanization on stone prevalence may be of greater magnitude. However, demonstration of a convincing link between urbanization and kidney stones is confounded by many variables simultaneously affected by migration to cities, such as changes in occupation, income, and diet. No data have yet been published supporting this proposed association. We explore the plausibility and limitations of this possible etiology of increasing kidney stone prevalence.

TI  - Risk of heat illness in men and women: A systematic review and meta-analysis
AU  - Gifford, R. M.; Todisco, T.; Stacey, M.; Fujisawa, T.; Allerhand, M.; Woods, D. R.; Reynolds, R. M.
AB  - Background: Heat illness (HI) is a growing global concern; its incidence has risen dramatically across the world in recent years. The individual factors whereby elevated core temperature produces HI are not well-understood. Given known physiological differences between men and women pertaining to temperature regulation, we hypothesized that women would be at increased risk of HI than men. Objective(s): We aimed to determine the relative risk of HI in women compared with men through an exhaustive literature review and meta-analysis. Method(s): We search PubMed and Ovid Medline databases from inception to Apr 2017. Search terms included all permutations of sex and heat illness (including heatstroke and exertional heat illness) with no language restrictions. We included adult or adolescent human data reporting comparable male and female HI rates. One reviewer identified and screened titles and abstracts. Two independent reviewers applied eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved with a third reviewer. Result(s): Of 5888 articles identified by searches, 36 were included in the systematic review and 22 in the meta-analysis. The mean (standard deviation) quality score was 3.31(1.25)/5. Overall the rate among women was consistently lower than men across the lifespan. The male: female pooled IRR was 2.28 (p < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.66-3.16). There was modest heterogeneity (between-studies variance (tau2) = 0.02). The rates did not differ significantly when corrected for severity or occupation. Discussion(s): The rate of HI was significantly increased in men compared with women. Risk for HI might be conferred by psychological and behavioral factors rather than physiological ones. Further research is required to delineate which groups are at greatest risk, leading to the development of mitigation strategies against HI. Other: No funding was received.

AB  - Background: Climate change can directly affect human health by varying exposure to non-optimal outdoor temperature. However, evidence on this direct impact at a global scale is limited, mainly due to issues in modelling and projecting complex and highly heterogeneous epidemiological relationships across different populations and climates., Methods: We collected observed daily time series of mean temperature and mortality counts for all causes or non-external causes only, in periods ranging from Jan 1, 1984, to Dec 31, 2015, from various locations across the globe through the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network. We estimated temperature-mortality relationships through a two-stage time series design. We generated current and future daily mean temperature series under four scenarios of climate change, determined by varying trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions, using five general circulation models. We projected excess mortality for cold and heat and their net change in 1990-2099 under each scenario of climate change, assuming no adaptation or population changes., Findings: Our dataset comprised 451 locations in 23 countries across nine regions of the world, including 85 879 895 deaths. Results indicate, on average, a net increase in temperature-related excess mortality under high-emission scenarios, although with important geographical differences. In temperate areas such as northern Europe, east Asia, and Australia, the less intense warming and large decrease in cold-related excess would induce a null or marginally negative net effect, with the net change in 2090-99 compared with 2010-19 ranging from -1.2% (empirical 95% CI -3.6 to 1.4) in Australia to -0.1% (-2.1 to 1.6) in east Asia under the highest emission scenario, although the decreasing trends would reverse during the course of the century. Conversely, warmer regions, such as the central and southern parts of America or Europe, and especially southeast Asia, would experience a sharp surge in heat-related impacts and extremely large net increases, with the net change at the end of the century ranging from 3.0% (-3.0 to 9.3) in Central America to 12.7% (-4.7 to 28.1) in southeast Asia under the highest emission scenario. Most of the health effects directly due to temperature increase could be avoided under scenarios involving mitigation strategies to limit emissions and further warming of the planet., Interpretation: This study shows the negative health impacts of climate change that, under high-emission scenarios, would disproportionately affect warmer and poorer regions of the world. Comparison with lower emission scenarios emphasises the importance of mitigation policies for limiting global warming and reducing the associated health risks., Funding: UK Medical Research Council.

TI  - The impact of heat waves on mortality
AU  - Gasparrini, Antonio; Armstrong, Ben
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat waves have been linked with an increase in mortality, but the associated risk has been only partly characterized., METHODS: We examined this association by decomposing the risk for temperature into a "main effect" due to independent effects of daily high temperatures, and an "added" effect due to sustained duration of heat during waves, using data from 108 communities in the United States during 1987-2000. We adopted different definitions of heat-wave days on the basis of combinations of temperature thresholds and days of duration. The main effect was estimated through distributed lag nonlinear functions of temperature, which account for nonlinear delayed effects and short-time harvesting. We defined the main effect as the relative risk between the median city-specific temperature during heat-wave days and the 75th percentile of the year-round distribution. The added effect was defined first using a simple indicator, and then a function of consecutive heat-wave days. City-specific main and added effects were pooled through univariate and multivariate meta-analytic techniques., RESULTS: The added wave effect was small (0.2%-2.8% excess relative risk, depending on wave definition) compared with the main effect (4.9%-8.0%), and was apparent only after 4 consecutive heat-wave days., CONCLUSIONS: Most of the excess risk with heat waves in the United States can be simply summarized as the independent effects of individual days' temperatures. A smaller added effect arises in heat waves lasting more than 4 days.

TI  - Urban Health System and Climate ResilienceüSurat Case Study
AU  - Desai, Vikas K.; Rathi, Suresh K.; Desai, Hemant
AB  - The demographic transition with rapid urbanisation corresponds with the challenges of urban infrastructure development. Urban health is an outcome of complex interaction of many urban factors including governance and finance. Coupled with this, climate change has overarching influence on these factors and a challenge to development, health and survival. Therefore, understanding impact of climate change with reference to urban health and development should be on high priority.Changes in climatic patterns may alter the distribution of vector species and increase its spread in new areas. An increase in temperature and relative humidity may enlarge the transmission window. Effluent emissions to water bodies and salination of rivers through sea level rise may increase the incidence of water borne diseases. Deaths due to heat wave are reported from several parts of the country. Every city is different and success of city specific urban health programme depends on city specific planning as well as public health preparedness for climate change. Hence, study of Climate and Health brings out threshold levels of climate resilience.Surat city experience of Urban health revealed that good governance and Finance were considered most important factors including Urban health system, community participation, Inter-sectoral convergence, disease surveillance, health information system, Publicüprivate partnership, participation of academic institutions and cross learning. One of the major advocacy areas UHCRC is embarking in is üInclusion of Climate resilience in Health and Health in Climate Resilience Planningü.

AU  - Esho, J. O.
AB  - An epidemiological survey of urinary calculous disease has been carried out in Nigeria. This involved the use of questionnaires, personal interview of doctors and clinical and autopsy reviews in several large medical centres in the country. It is evident that urinary calculi are rare among Nigerians in spite of the high temperature and high carbohydrate diet. There does not appear to be any particular tribe or geographical location that is more predisposed to stone formation than the others. It is possible that the low calcium content of Nigerian waters, the minimal consumption of dairy products, the physically active life and some other unknown factors protect Nigerians against urinary calculus formation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop public health adaptation strategies and to project the impacts of climate change on human health, indicators of vulnerability and preparedness along with accurate surveillance data on climate-sensitive health outcomes are needed. We researched and developed environmental health indicators for inputs into human health vulnerability assessments for climate change and to propose public health preventative actions., DATA SOURCES: We conducted a review of the scientific literature to identify outcomes and actions that were related to climate change. Data sources included governmental and nongovernmental agencies and the published literature., DATA EXTRACTION: Sources were identified and assessed for completeness, usability, and accuracy. Priority was then given to identifying longitudinal data sets that were applicable at the state and community level., DATA SYNTHESIS: We present a list of surveillance indicators for practitioners and policy makers that include climate-sensitive health outcomes and environmental and vulnerability indicators, as well as mitigation, adaptation, and policy indicators of climate change., CONCLUSIONS: A review of environmental health indicators for climate change shows that data exist for many of these measures, but more evaluation of their sensitivity and usefulness is needed. Further attention is necessary to increase data quality and availability and to develop new surveillance databases, especially for climate-sensitive morbidity.

AU  - Christenson, Megan L.; Geiger, Sarah Dee; Anderson, Henry A.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hottest year on record for the contiguous United States was 2012. July 2012 ranked as Wisconsin's fourth warmest July, which has profound implications for heat-related mortality., METHODS: We conducted a case series of 27 heat-related fatalities in Wisconsin during summer 2012. Data from death certificates supplemented by coroner reports were analyzed to characterize factors that increase vulnerability to heat-related fatality., RESULTS: The 2012 heat-related fatalities occurred in both urban and rural counties. All cases had 1 or more known risk factors: 100% lacked functioning residential air conditioning; 70% were over age 65; 75% had a cardiovascular disease; and 52% had a mental health condition. Of the 14 cases with a mental health condition, half were known to be taking psychotropic medication. None of the decedents had been in air conditioning immediately prior to death, and 8 (36%) had been using fans., CONCLUSIONS: Air conditioning is known to be a strong protective factor in preventing heat-related deaths whereas fans have not been shown to be significantly protective across all exposure situations. Prevention efforts should stress reducing social isolation by encouraging checks by friends, neighbors, or police. Prevention messages should also warn patients on psychotropic medications that the medication could increase their risk of heat-related illness or fatality.

TI  - Impacts of temperature change on ambulance dispatches and seasonal effect modification

AB  - Ambulance dispatch is a proxy of acute health outcomes, and growing epidemiological evidence documented its relation to extreme temperature events. Research, however, on short-term temperature change and ambulance dispatches is scarce. We aimed to investigate the effect of short-term temperature change on ambulance dispatches and potential modification by season. Daily data on ambulance dispatch and weather factors were collected in Huainan, a Chinese inland city from December 2011 through December 2013. A Poison generalized linear regression model combined with distributed lag nonlinear model was constructed to examine the association of temperature change between neighboring days (TCN) with ambulance dispatches. The effect modification by season was also examined. There were 48,700 ambulance attendances during the study period. A statistically significant association of TCN with ambulance dispatches was observed. Temperature rise between neighboring days (TCN > 0) was associated with elevated adverse risk of ambulance dispatches, and the effects appeared to be acute (lag0, on the current day) and could last for at least a week, while temperature drop between neighboring days (TCN < 0) had a protective effect. For a 1 degreeC increase of TCN at lag0 and lag06 (on the 7-day moving average), the risk of ambulance dispatches increased by 2 % (95 % CI 1-3 %) and 7 (95 % CI 1-13 %), respectively. Extreme TCN increase (95th percentile, 3.3 degreeC vs. 0 degreeC) at lag0 and lag05 was accompanied by 6 (95 % CI 3-8 %) and 27 % (95 % CI 12-44 %) increase in ambulance dispatches. Ambulance dispatches were more vulnerable to extremely great temperature rise in summer and autumn. TCN was adopted for the first time to quantify the impact of short-term temperature change on ambulance dispatches. Temperature drop between neighboring days (TCN < 0) had a protective effect on ambulance dispatches, while temperature rise between neighboring days (TCN > 0) could acutely trigger the increase in ambulance dispatches, and TCN effect differs by season.

AU  - Chen, Chieh-Fan; Ho, Wen-Hsien; Chou, Huei-Yin; Yang, Shu-Mei; Chen, I. Te; Shi, Hon-Yi
AB  - This study analyzed meteorological, clinical and economic factors in terms of their effects on monthly ED revenue and visitor volume. Monthly data from January 1, 2005 to September 30, 2009 were analyzed. Spearman correlation and cross-correlation analyses were performed to identify the correlation between each independent variable, ED revenue, and visitor volume. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to quantify the relationship between each independent variable, ED revenue, and visitor volume. The accuracies were evaluated by comparing model forecasts to actual values with mean absolute percentage of error. Sensitivity of prediction errors to model training time was also evaluated. The ARIMA models indicated that mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, non-trauma, and trauma visits may correlate positively with ED revenue, but mean minimum temperature may correlate negatively with ED revenue. Moreover, mean minimum temperature and stock market index fluctuation may correlate positively with trauma visitor volume. Mean maximum temperature, relative humidity and stock market index fluctuation may correlate positively with non-trauma visitor volume. Mean maximum temperature and relative humidity may correlate positively with pediatric visitor volume, but mean minimum temperature may correlate negatively with pediatric visitor volume. The model also performed well in forecasting revenue and visitor volume.

TI  - Is planned adaptation to heat reducing heat-related mortality and illness? A systematic review
AU  - Boeckmann, Melanie; Rohn, Ines
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extreme heat is an important public health risk. Climate change will likely increase the temperatures humans are exposed to through exacerbated heat wave intensity and frequency, possibly increasing health risks from heat. To prevent adverse effects on human health, heat prevention plans and climate change adaptation strategies are being implemented. But are these measures effectively reducing heat-related mortality and morbidity? This study assesses the evidence base in 2014., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed published literature. We applied a combined search strategy of automated search and journal content search using the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses A&I. Quality appraisal was conducted using CASP checklists, and we identified recurrent themes in studies with content analysis methodology. We conducted sub-group analyses for two types of studies: survey and interview research on behavioral change and perception, and observational studies with regression., RESULTS: 30 articles were included in the review. The majority of studies (n = 17) assessed mortality or morbidity reductions with regression analysis. Overall, the assessments report a reduction of adverse effects during extreme heat in places where preventive measures have been implemented. Population perception and behavior change were assessed in five studies, none of which had carried out a pre-test. Two themes emerged from the review: methodological challenges are a major hindrance to rigorous evaluation, and what counts as proof of an effective reduction in adverse health outcomes is disputed., CONCLUSIONS: Attributing health outcomes to heat adaptation remains a challenge. Recent study designs are less rigorous due to difficulties assigning the counterfactual. While sensitivity to heat is decreasing, the examined studies provide inconclusive evidence on individual planned adaptation measures.

TI  - Time series regression studies in environmental epidemiology
AU  - Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Gasparrini, Antonio; Hajat, Shakoor; Smeeth, Liam; Armstrong, Ben
AB  - Time series regression studies have been widely used in environmental epidemiology, notably in investigating the short-term associations between exposures such as air pollution, weather variables or pollen, and health outcomes such as mortality, myocardial infarction or disease-specific hospital admissions. Typically, for both exposure and outcome, data are available at regular time intervals (e.g. daily pollution levels and daily mortality counts) and the aim is to explore short-term associations between them. In this article, we describe the general features of time series data, and we outline the analysis process, beginning with descriptive analysis, then focusing on issues in time series regression that differ from other regression methods: modelling short-term fluctuations in the presence of seasonal and long-term patterns, dealing with time varying confounding factors and modelling delayed ('lagged') associations between exposure and outcome. We finish with advice on model checking and sensitivity analysis, and some common extensions to the basic model.

TI  - Municipal heat wave response plans
AU  - Bernard, Susan M.; McGeehin, Michael A.
AB  - Approximately 400 people die from extreme heat each year in the United States, and the risk of heat waves may increase as a result of global climate change. Despite the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality, many cities lack written heat response plans. In a review of plans from 18 cities at risk for heat-related mortality, we found that many cities had inadequate or no heat response plans. This is an important area for further investigation and government attention.

TI  - Heat waves and climate change: applying the health belief model to identify predictors of risk perception and adaptive behaviours in adelaide, australia
AU  - Akompab, Derick A.; Bi, Peng; Williams, Susan; Grant, Janet; Walker, Iain A.; Augoustinos, Martha
AB  - Heat waves are considered a health risk and they are likely to increase in frequency, intensity and duration as a consequence of climate change. The effects of heat waves on human health could be reduced if individuals recognise the risks and adopt healthy behaviours during a heat wave. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of risk perception using a heat wave scenario and identify the constructs of the health belief model that could predict adaptive behaviours during a heat wave. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the summer of 2012 among a sample of persons aged between 30 to 69 years in Adelaide. Participants ' perceptions were assessed using the health belief model as a conceptual frame. Their knowledge about heat waves and adaptive behaviours during heat waves was also assessed. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictors of risk perception to a heat wave scenario and adaptive behaviours during a heat wave. Of the 267 participants, about half (50.9%) had a high risk perception to heat waves while 82.8% had good adaptive behaviours during a heat wave. Multivariate models found that age was a significant predictor of risk perception. In addition, participants who were married (OR = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.62), who earned a gross annual household income of >=$60,000 (OR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.94) and without a fan (OR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.79) were less likely to have a high risk perception to heat waves. Those who were living with others (OR = 2.87; 95% CI, 1.19-6.90) were more likely to have a high risk perception to heat waves. On the other hand, participants with a high perceived benefit (OR = 2.14; 95% CI, 1.00-4.58), a high "cues to action" (OR = 3.71; 95% CI, 1.63-8.43), who had additional training or education after high school (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.25-5.58) and who earned a gross annual household income of >=$60,000 (OR = 2.66; 95% CI, 1.07-6.56) were more likely to have good adaptive behaviours during a heat wave. The health belief model could be useful to guide the design and implementation of interventions to promote adaptive behaviours during heat waves.

TI  - Effects of Increasing Aridity on Ambient Dust and Public Health in the U.S. Southwest Under Climate Change
AU  - Achakulwisut, Pattanun; Anenberg, Susan C.; Neumann, James E.; Penn, Stefani L.; Weiss, Natalie; Crimmins, Allison; Fann, Neal; Martinich, Jeremy; Roman, Henry; Mickley, Loretta J.
AB  - The U.S. Southwest is projected to experience increasing aridity due to climate change. We quantify the resulting impacts on ambient dust levels and public health using methods consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis framework. We first demonstrate that U.S. Southwest fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) dust levels are strongly sensitive to variability in the 2-month Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index across southwestern North America. We then estimate potential changes in dust levels through 2099 by applying the observed sensitivities to downscaled meteorological output projected by six climate models following an intermediate (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, RCP4.5) and a high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas concentration scenario. By 2080-2099 under RCP8.5 relative to 1986-2005 in the U.S. Southwest: (1) Fine dust levels could increase by 57%, and fine dust-attributable all-cause mortality and hospitalizations could increase by 230% and 360%, respectively; (2) coarse dust levels could increase by 38%, and coarse dust-attributable cardiovascular mortality and asthma emergency department visits could increase by 210% and 88%, respectively; (3) climate-driven changes in dust concentrations can account for 34-47% of these health impacts, with the rest due to increases in population and baseline incidence rates; and (4) economic damages of the health impacts could total $47 billion per year additional to the 1986-2005 value of $13 billion per year. Compared to national-scale climate impacts projected for other U.S. sectors using the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis framework, dust-related mortality ranks fourth behind extreme temperature-related mortality, labor productivity decline, and coastal property loss.

TI  - Report of 182 cases of exertional heatstroke in the French Armed Forces
AU  - Abriat, Amandine; Brosset, Christian; Bregigeon, Michel; Sagui, Emmanuel
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Exertional heatstroke (EHS) remains a major problem for the military. The aim of our study was to describe medical history and clinical and biological features of EHS in a large military cohort., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study among military subjects admitted to the Military Teaching Hospital Laveran for EHS from 2004 to 2006., RESULTS: Of the 182 subjects, EHS occurred most often at the end (80%) of a timed race of 8 km in battle clothes (84%) between the months of May and October (87%). The subjects were physically fit. Motivation was the primary intrinsic factor reported. A previous episode of EHS was reported by 15.4% of the subjects. Comas or seizures occurred more frequently in subjects whose temperatures exceeded 41degreeC (p = 0.03). Alanine aminotransferase was consistently increased in subjects who experienced EHS. We observed acute renal failure in 31.3% of the subjects, liver insufficiency in 12%, and disseminated intravascular coagulation in 1%. High creatine kinase levels alone did not correlate with renal failure., CONCLUSIONS: Detection of severe EHS in the field before the onset of multiple organ failure is challenging. The determination of the factors contributing to recurrence is urgently needed as EHS remains a life-threatening condition. Reprint & Copyright 漏 2014 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.
